goals, the number of shares issued under an Award of Performance Shares may be adjusted on the basis of such further consideration as the Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion. However,
the Committee may not, in any event, increase the number of shares earned upon satisfaction of any performance goal by any Covered Employee. The Committee, in its discretion, may make a cash payment
equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock otherwise required to be issued to a Participant pursuant to an Award of Performance Shares. </FONT></P>

terms and conditions specified by the Committee. Notwithstanding the satisfaction of any performance goals, the amount to be paid under an Award of Performance Units may be adjusted on the basis of
such further consideration as the Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion. However, the Committee may not, in any event, increase the amount earned under Performance Unit Awards upon
satisfaction of any performance goal by any Covered Employee, and the maximum amount earned by such Covered Employee in any calendar year may not exceed $1,000,000. The Committee, in its discretion,

required tax withholding rate, and the value of any shares so tendered may not exceed such rate to the extent the Participant has owned the tendered shares for less than six months, if such
limitations are required to avoid a charge to the Company's earnings for financial reporting purposes under applicable accounting rules. The value of any shares withheld or surrendered may not exceed

are to be assumed or substituted by a Successor Company without acceleration upon the occurrence of a Company Transaction, the terms and conditions of the foregoing Awards shall continue with respect

authorized action may include (but shall not be limited to) establishing, amending or waiving the type, terms, conditions or duration of, or restrictions on, Awards
so as to provide for earlier, later, extended or additional time for exercise, lifting restrictions and other modifications, and the Committee may take such actions with respect to all Participants,

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board or the Human Resources Committee of the Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any portion of the Plan at any time and in such respects as it
shall deem advisable; provided, however, that, to the extent required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule, shareholder approval shall be required for any amendment to the Plan. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>16.2&nbsp;Term of the Plan  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless sooner terminated as provided herein, the Plan shall terminate ten years from the Effective Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incentive Stock Options
may be granted more than ten years after the earlier of (a)&nbsp;the adoption of the Plan by the Board and (b)&nbsp;the Effective Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
the Plan is terminated, no future Awards may be granted, but Awards previously granted shall remain outstanding in accordance with their applicable terms and conditions and the
Plan's terms and conditions. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>16.3&nbsp;Consent of Participant  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan or a portion thereof or the amendment of an outstanding Award shall not, without the Participant's consent,
materially adversely affect any rights under any Award theretofore granted to the Participant under the Plan. Any change or adjustment to an outstanding Incentive Stock Option shall not, without the
consent of the Participant, be made in a manner so as to constitute a "modification" that would cause such Incentive Stock Option to fail to continue to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustments made pursuant to Sections 15.1 through 15.3 shall not be subject to these restrictions. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>SECTION 17. GENERAL  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>17.1&nbsp;No Individual Rights  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No individual or Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and the Company has no obligation for uniformity of treatment of
Participants under the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to constitute an employment contract or confer or be deemed to confer on any Participant any right to
continue in the employ of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company or any Related Company or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Related Company to terminate a
Participant's employment or other relationship at any time, with or without Cause. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>17.2&nbsp;Issuance of Shares  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver any shares of Common Stock under the Plan or make any
other distribution of benefits under the Plan unless, in the opinion of the Company's counsel, such issuance, delivery or distribution would comply with all applicable laws (including, without
limitation, the requirements of the Securities Act or the laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction) and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company shall be under no obligation to any Participant to register for offering or resale or to qualify for exemption under the Securities Act, or to register or qualify under the
laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction, any shares of Common Stock, security or interest in a security paid or issued under, or created by, the Plan, or to continue in effect any such registrations
or qualifications if made. The Company may issue certificates for shares with such legends and subject to such restrictions on transfer and stop-transfer instructions as counsel for the
Company deems necessary or desirable for compliance by the Company with federal, state and foreign securities laws. The Company may also require such other action or agreement by the Participants as
may from time to time be necessary to comply with applicable securities laws. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
the extent the Plan or any instrument evidencing an Award provides for issuance of stock certificates to reflect the issuance of shares of Common Stock, the issuance may be effected
on a noncertificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>17.3&nbsp;Indemnification  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each person who is or shall have been a member of the Board, or a Committee appointed by the Board, or an officer of the Company to whom authority was delegated
in accordance with Section&nbsp;3 shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any loss, cost, liability or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him
or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to
act under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company's approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such
claim, action, suit or proceeding against him or her; provided that he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to
handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf, unless such loss, cost, liability or expense is a result of his or her own willful misconduct
or except as expressly provided by statute. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company's articles of incorporation
or bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or of any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>17.4&nbsp;No Rights as a Shareholder  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise provided by the Committee or in the instrument evidencing the Award or in a written employment agreement, no Option or Award denominated in units
shall entitle the Participant to any cash dividend, voting or other right of a shareholder unless and until the date of issuance under the Plan of the shares that are the subject of such Award. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>17.5&nbsp;Compliance With Laws and Regulations  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may bifurcate the Plan so as to restrict, limit or condition the use
of any provision of the Plan to Participants who are officers or directors subject to Section&nbsp;16 of the Exchange Act without so restricting, limiting or conditioning the Plan with respect to
other Participants. Additionally, in interpreting and applying the provisions of the Plan, any Option granted as an Incentive Stock Option pursuant to the Plan shall, to the extent permitted by law,
be construed as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section&nbsp;422 of the Code. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>17.6&nbsp;Participants in Other Countries  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall have the authority to adopt such modifications, procedures and subplans as may be necessary or desirable to comply with provisions of the laws
of other countries in which the Company or any Related Company may operate to ensure the viability of the benefits from Awards
granted to Participants employed in such countries, to comply with applicable foreign laws and to meet the objectives of the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>17.7&nbsp;No Trust or Fund  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan. Nothing contained herein shall require the Company to segregate any monies or other property, or shares of
Common Stock, or to create any trusts, or to make any special deposits for any immediate or deferred amounts payable to any Participant, and no Participant shall have any rights that are greater than
those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>17.8&nbsp;Successors  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is
the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all the business and/or assets of the Company. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>17.9&nbsp;Severability  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any provision of the Plan or any Award is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person, or would disqualify the
Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or, if it cannot be so construed or deemed
amended without, in the Committee's determination, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder
of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>17.10&nbsp;Choice of Law  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan, all Awards granted thereunder and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant hereto, to the extent not otherwise governed by the laws of the
