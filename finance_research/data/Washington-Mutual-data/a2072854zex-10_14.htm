the Participant, payment of so much of the Participant's Account as is required to meet the need created by the emergency. For the purposes hereof, an "unforeseeable emergency" is an unanticipated
emergency that is caused by an event beyond the control of the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary and that would result in severe financial hardship to the individual if early withdrawal
were not permitted. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, an unforeseeable emergency shall include a sudden and unexpected illness or accident of the Participant or of a dependent (as
defined in Code &sect; 152(a)) of the Participant, loss of the Participant's property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of
events beyond the Participant's control. The circumstances that will constitute an unforeseeable emergency will depend on the facts of each case, as determined by the Plan Administration Committee in

of Claim</U>. If a claim for benefits is denied in whole or in part, the Plan Administration Committee shall notify the claimant of such
denial and of his or her right to a conference with an individual designated in the notice for the purpose of explaining the denial. If the claimant does not want such a conference, or is dissatisfied
with its outcome, he or she shall be furnished in writing, in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, specific reasons for such denial, specific references to the Plan provisions on
which the denial is based, a description of any additional material necessary for him or her to perfect his or her claim, an explanation of why such material is necessary, and an explanation of the
Plan's review procedure as described in Section&nbsp;7.3. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Review

or in part, may appeal from such denial to the Plan Administration Committee by submitting to the Committee a written request for review within 75&nbsp;days after receiving notice of denial. The
Plan Administration Committee shall give the claimant an opportunity to review pertinent documents relating to the denial in preparing his or her request for
review. The request must set forth all the grounds upon which it is based, supporting facts and documents, and any other matters that the claimant deems pertinent, and the relief sought. The Committee
may require the claimant to submit such additional facts, documents or other material as it deems necessary or advisable in making its review. The Plan Administration Committee shall act upon a
request for review within 60&nbsp;days after receipt thereof unless special circumstances require further time, but in no event later than 120&nbsp;days after such receipt. If the Plan
Administration Committee confirms the denial in whole or in part, the Committee shall give written notice to the claimant setting forth, in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, the
specific reasons for denial and specific reference to the Plan provisions on which the decision was based. The determination of the Plan Administration Committee upon such review shall be final and
conclusive and shall be binding on the claimant and all persons claimed by, through or under him or her, subject, however, to any right of appeal under applicable law. </FONT></P>
