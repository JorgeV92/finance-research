<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washington Mutual,&nbsp;Inc. (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Company</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), by action of the Board and approval of its shareholders,
established the Washington Mutual,&nbsp;Inc. 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Plan</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). The Participant is employed by the Company or a Related Company
(or in the case of a Nonqualified Stock Option, the Participant is an employee, director, consultant, agent, advisor or independent contractor of the Company or a Related Company) and the Company
desires to encourage the Participant to own Common Stock for the purposes stated in Section&nbsp;1 of the Plan. In consideration of the foregoing, the parties have entered into this Stock Option
Agreement (this "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Agreement</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") to govern the terms of the Option (as defined below) granted by the Company. Defined terms in the Plan shall have the same
meaning in this Agreement, except where the context otherwise requires. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant of Option  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the grant date (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Grant Date</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") set forth in the electronic Notice of Grant ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Notice
of Grant</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") provided to the Participant named therein, the Company has granted to the Participant a right to purchase up to the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock at
the purchase price per share (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Exercise Price</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), each as adjusted from time to time pursuant to Section&nbsp;15 of the Plan, set forth in the
Notice of Grant, which right shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Notice of Grant, this Agreement, and the Plan (as amended from time to time) (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Option</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). The Participant shall not be entitled to any of the benefits under this Option unless and until the Participant accepts the Option grant
through the electronic grant notification system maintained by or on behalf of the Company. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>By accepting the Option grant, the Participant irrevocably agrees on behalf of the
Participant and the Participant's successors and permitted assigns to all of the terms and conditions of the Option as set forth in or pursuant to the Notice of Grant, this Agreement, and the Plan (as
such may be amended from time to time).  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

experienced a Termination of Service, the Option shall become vested and exercisable on the anniversary of the Grant Date specified below with respect to a number of shares of Common Stock (rounded to
the nearest whole share) equal to the percentage of the total number of shares subject to the Option in accordance with the following schedule: </FONT></P>

vesting period and/or exercisability of the Option set forth in Paragraph&nbsp;2(a) may be adjusted by the Committee to reflect the decreased level of employment
during any period in which the Participant is on an approved leave of absence or is employed on a less than full time basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Paragraph&nbsp;2, the
Option shall be subject to earlier acceleration of exercisability and/or expiration of the Option as otherwise provided in any other written agreement between the Participant and the Company or a
Related Company and, to the extent not inconsistent with any such written agreement, as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement and under the Plan (for example, in connection with a Company

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
the extent then exercisable, the Option may be exercised, from time to time prior to its expiration, in whole or in part by notifying the Company or its designee of
such exercise in such manner as the Company may from time to time require, which notice shall specify the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is to be exercised and be accompanied by
evidence satisfactory to the Committee of such person's right to exercise the Option if the person exercising the Option is not the Participant, and which notice shall provide for payment of the
Option Exercise Price in accordance with Section&nbsp;7.5 of the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Transferability of Option  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as provided in Section&nbsp;14 of the Plan, the Option is not transferable and the Participant may not make any disposition of the Option or any interest
therein. (Section&nbsp;14 of the Plan permits transfers by will and by the laws of descent and distribution and permits the Participant to designate one or more beneficiaries on a Company-approved
form who can exercise an Option following the Participant's death. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may also permit the Participant to assign or transfer an Option, to the extent permitted under
the Plan.) As used herein, "disposition" means any sale, transfer, encumbrance, gift, donation, assignment, pledge, hypothecation, or other disposition, whether similar or dissimilar to those
previously enumerated, whether voluntary or involuntary, and whether during the Participant's lifetime or upon or after the Participant's death, including, but not limited to, any disposition by
operation of law, by court order, by judicial process, or by foreclosure, levy, or attachment. Any attempted disposition in violation of this Paragraph&nbsp;3 and Section&nbsp;14 of the Plan shall
be void. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Participant shall not be deemed a shareholder of the Company with respect to any of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Option, except to the extent
that such shares shall have been purchased and transferred to him or her. The Company shall not be required to issue or transfer any certificates for shares of Common Stock purchased upon exercise of
the Option until all applicable requirements of law have been complied with and such shares shall have been duly listed on any securities exchange on which the Common Stock may then be listed. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Effect on Capital Structure  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Option shall not affect the right of the Company or any Related Company to reclassify, recapitalize or otherwise change its capital or debt structure or to
merge, consolidate, convey any or all of its assets, dissolve, liquidate, windup, or otherwise reorganize. </FONT></P>

the extent that the Notice of Grant specifies that the Option is intended to be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option, the Option shall not be subject to tax
treatment as an Incentive Stock Option. To the extent that the Notice of Grant specifies that the Option is intended to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option, the Option is intended to qualify to
the greatest extent possible as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section&nbsp;422 of the Code, and shall be so construed; provided, however, that nothing in the Notice of Grant,

first became exercisable as to such shares, plus (ii)&nbsp;the aggregate exercise price for shares under any of the Participant's other concurrently or previously granted incentive stock options
that first became exercisable in that same calendar year, exceeds $100,000. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if and to the extent that any shares are issued under a portion
of this Option that exceeds the foregoing $100,000 limitation, such shares shall not be treated as issued under an incentive stock option. In such an event, the Participant shall be subject to the tax
withholding provisions of Section&nbsp;13 of the Plan for the portion of the Option that is not an Incentive Stock Option, and to all other Plan provisions that apply to Nonqualified Stock Options
with respect to such portion of the Option. To the maximum extent possible, the portion of an Option intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option that expires upon a Termination of Service shall
be the portion (if any) that does not so qualify, so as to preserve incentive stock option treatment for the Option to the greatest extent possible. Certain decisions, amendments and interpretations
by the Committee of this Option may cause the Option to cease to qualify as an incentive stock option pursuant to the Code and by accepting this Option the Participant agrees in advance to such
disqualifying action. </FONT></P>

unless the Participant ceased to be employed due to death or Disability, and within one (1)&nbsp;year after the Participant ceases to be employed by the Company or a Related Company on account of
disability (as defined in Section&nbsp;22(e)(3) of the Code), and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Participant must not sell the shares of Common Stock received upon exercising any Incentive Stock Option within two (2)&nbsp;years from the date of the grant of
the Option nor within one (1)&nbsp;year from the date of exercise of the Option. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>With
respect to any Option that is intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option in full or as to any portion of the shares issuable thereunder, the Participant's exercise notice delivered pursuant
to
Paragraph&nbsp;2 of this Agreement with respect to such Option shall indicate whether the Participant intends to satisfy the foregoing requirements. The Participant is advised to consult with his or
her own tax advisor on any questions related to the tax treatment of the Option. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent that the Option is designated in the Notice of Grant as being intended to be an Incentive Stock Option, the Participant shall notify the Company of
his or her intent to dispose of any of the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to the Option within two (2)&nbsp;years from the date of the grant of the Option or one (1)&nbsp;year from the
date of exercise of the Option, and promptly after such disposition the Participant shall notify the Company of the number of shares of Common Stock disposed of, the dates of acquisition and
disposition of such shares, and the consideration, if any, received on such disposition. If in connection with any such disposition the Company becomes liable for withholding taxes and has no amounts
owing the Participant with which it may offset and discharge its withholding obligation, the Participant shall pay over to the Company with the amount needed to discharge the Company's withholding
obligation and shall indemnify the Company against any penalties it may incur if it does not satisfy such obligations as a result of Participant failing to pay the Company the amount of such
withholding obligation. The Company will report this disposition on Form&nbsp;W-2. Nothing in this Paragraph shall give the Participant any right to dispose of shares of Common Stock in
a manner that is inconsistent with any provision of this Agreement, the Plan, or any stock transfer restriction agreement entered into by the Participant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washington Mutual,&nbsp;Inc. (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Company</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), by action of the Board and approval of its shareholders,
established the Washington Mutual,&nbsp;Inc. 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Plan</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). The Participant is employed by the Company or a Related Company
(or in the case of a Nonqualified Stock Option, the Participant is an employee, director, consultant, agent, advisor or independent contractor of the Company or a Related Company) and the Company
desires to encourage the Participant to own Common Stock for the purposes stated in Section&nbsp;1 of the Plan. In consideration of the foregoing, the parties have entered into this Stock Option
Agreement (this "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Agreement</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") to govern the terms of the Option (as defined below) granted by the Company. Defined terms in the Plan shall have the same
meaning in this Agreement, except where the context otherwise requires. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the grant date (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Grant Date</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") set forth in the electronic Notice of Grant ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Notice

"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Option</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>By accepting the Option grant, the Participant irrevocably agrees on behalf of the Participant and the Participant's
successors and permitted assigns to all of the terms and conditions of the Option as set forth in or pursuant to the Notice of Grant, this Agreement, and the Plan (as such may be amended from time to
time).</I></FONT></P>

vesting period and/or exercisability of the Option set forth in Paragraph&nbsp;2(a) may be adjusted by the Committee to reflect the decreased level of employment
during any period in which the Participant is on an approved leave of absence or is employed on a less than full time basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Paragraph&nbsp;2, the
Option shall be subject to earlier acceleration of exercisability and/or expiration of the Option as otherwise provided in any other written agreement between the Participant and the Company or a

evidence satisfactory to the Committee of such person's right to exercise the Option if the person exercising the Option is not the Participant, and which notice shall provide for payment of the

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as provided in Section&nbsp;14 of the Plan, the Option is not transferable and the Participant may not make any disposition of the Option or any interest
therein. (Section&nbsp;14 of the Plan permits transfers by will and by the laws of descent and distribution and permits the Participant to designate one or more beneficiaries on a Company-approved
form who can exercise an Option following the Participant's death. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may also permit the Participant to assign or transfer an Option, to the extent permitted under
the Plan.) As used herein, "disposition" means any sale, transfer, encumbrance, gift, donation, assignment, pledge, hypothecation, or other disposition, whether similar or dissimilar to those
previously enumerated, whether voluntary or involuntary, and whether during the Participant's lifetime or upon or after the Participant's death, including, but not limited to, any disposition by
operation of law, by court order, by judicial process, or by foreclosure, levy, or attachment. Any attempted disposition in violation of this Paragraph&nbsp;3 and Section&nbsp;14 of the Plan shall
be void. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Participant shall not be deemed a shareholder of the Company with respect to any of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Option, except to the extent
that such shares shall have been purchased and transferred to him or her. The Company shall not be required to issue or transfer any certificates for shares of Common Stock purchased upon exercise of
the Option until all applicable requirements of law have been complied with and such shares shall have been duly listed on any securities exchange on which the Common Stock may then be listed. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Option shall not affect the right of the Company or any Related Company to reclassify, recapitalize or otherwise change its capital or debt structure or to
