<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This Amendment No.&nbsp;1 (this &#147;Amendment&#148;) amends the Annual Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K</FONT> of WMIH Corp., a Delaware
corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;, &#147;WMIH&#148;, &#147;we&#148;, &#147;our&#148; or &#147;us&#148;) for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) on
March&nbsp;2, 2018 (the &#147;Original Filing&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This Amendment is being filed for the purpose of providing the information required by Items 10

the above-referenced Items to be incorporated in an annual report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K</FONT> by reference from a definitive proxy statement, if such definitive proxy statement is filed no later than 120 days after the
registrant&#146;s fiscal year end. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February&nbsp;12, 2018, WMIH, Wand Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of WMIH,
and Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;Nationstar&#148;), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Wand Merger
Corporation will merge with and into Nationstar (the &#147;Merger&#148;), with Nationstar continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of WMIH. The Merger is expected to close in the second half of 2018, subject to approval
by WMIH&#146;s and Nationstar&#146;s shareholders and other customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals. For further information, see the Company&#146;s Registration Statement on Form <FONT

this Amendment shall have the same meaning as in the Original Filing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In accordance with Rule <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">12b-15</FONT> under the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, the board of directors (the &#147;Board&#148;) held 18 formal meetings. The Board has established four
standing committees: an audit committee, compensation committee, corporate strategy and development committee and nominating and corporate governance committee. In 2017, the Board established a finance committee, which is described in more detail
below. Each director attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings held by the Board and the committees of the Board on which he or she served during fiscal year 2017 (or such portion of the year during which such director served on the
Board). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board, following a recommendation by the WMIH nominating and corporate governance committee, has adopted a policy with respect to board
member attendance at annual stockholder meetings. In accordance with such policy, the Board encourages all directors to make attendance at the WMIH annual meeting a priority. Last year, all directors, other than those not seeking reelection and who
were members of the Board at the time of the annual meeting, were in attendance in person or by telephone at the WMIH annual meeting of stockholders. </P>

committee collaborated with the WMIH finance committee to evaluate and approve the amendment of the terms of WMIH Series B preferred stock and other WMIH acquisition and financing activities. The WMIH audit committee held 7 meetings during the
fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Michael L. Willingham (Chair), Diane B. Glossman, Michael J. Renoff and Steven D. Scheiwe, each of whom meets

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board has delegated to the WMIH compensation committee responsibility for considering and approving the compensation programs and awards for all of
WMIH&#146;s executive officers, including the named executive officers identified below under &#147;&#151;<I>Summary Compensation Table</I>&#148;. The WMIH compensation committee consists entirely of independent,

listing standards. The WMIH nominating and corporate governance committee is governed by a written charter, a current copy of which is available on WMIH&#146;s website at www.wmih-corp.com. During the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, the
WMIH nominating and corporate governance committee held at least one (1)&nbsp;meeting and otherwise elected to act on other business via unanimous written consent as contemplated by its charter. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The functions of the WMIH nominating and corporate governance committee are to carry out the duties and responsibilities delegated by the Board relating to
WMIH&#146;s director nominations process, oversight of the evaluation of directors and development and maintenance of WMIH&#146;s corporate governance principles and policies. The committee is authorized by its charter to engage its own advisors.
WMIH&#146;s board is responsible for nominating members for election to WMIH&#146;s board and for filling vacancies on the Board that may occur between annual meetings of stockholders. The WMIH nominating and corporate governance committee is
responsible for identifying, screening and recommending to WMIH&#146;s board candidates for board membership. The committee recommended the nomination of the candidates reflected in the director election. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Nominees for director are selected on the basis of, among other things, knowledge, experience, skills, expertise, integrity, diversity, ability to make
independent analytical inquiries, and understanding of WMIH&#146;s business environment, all in the context of an assessment of the perceived needs of the Board at the time. Nominees should also be willing to devote adequate time and effort to board
responsibilities. The WMIH nominating and corporate governance committee does not set specific, minimum qualifications that nominees must meet in order for the WMIH nominating and corporate governance committee to recommend them to the Board, but
rather believes that each nominee should be evaluated based on his or her individual merit, taking into account the needs of WMIH and the composition of the Board. The WMIH nominating and corporate governance committee will consider WMIH stockholder
recommendations for candidates to serve on the Board. Candidates suggested by WMIH stockholders will be evaluated by the same criteria and process as candidates from other sources. Formal nomination of candidates by WMIH stockholders requires
compliance with Section&nbsp;2.13 of the Bylaws, including sending timely notice of the candidate&#146;s name, biographical information, and qualifications, and certain information regarding the WMIH stockholder making the nomination, to the
Secretary of WMIH at WMIH Corp., 800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 4100, Seattle, Washington 98104. In order for a notice of WMIH stockholder nomination to be considered timely, a WMIH stockholder must deliver the notice to the Secretary at WMIH&#146;s
principal executive offices no later than 90 calendar days and no earlier than 120 calendar days prior to the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-year</FONT> anniversary of the date on which WMIH&#146;s proxy statement was released to WMIH
stockholders in connection with the previous year&#146;s annual meeting of WMIH stockholders; provided, however, if the annual meeting of WMIH stockholders is convened more than 30 days prior to the anniversary of the preceding year&#146;s annual
meeting or delayed by more than 30 days after the anniversary of the preceding year&#146;s annual meeting or if no annual meeting was held in the preceding year, the notice by the WMIH stockholder must be received not later than the close of
business on the later of the 90th calendar day before such annual meeting and the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. There is otherwise no formal process prescribed for identifying and
evaluating nominees, including no formal diversity policy. </P>

developed and maintains processes to manage risk in WMIH&#146;s operations. The Board&#146;s role in risk management is primarily one of oversight, with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">day-to-day</FONT></FONT>
responsibility for risk management implemented by the management team. The Board executes its oversight role directly and through its various committees. The WMIH audit committee has principal responsibility for implementing the Board&#146;s risk
management oversight role. The WMIH audit committee is also responsible for reviewing conflict of interest transactions and handling complaints about accounting and auditing matters and violations of WMIH&#146;s code of conduct and code of ethics.
Any waivers of the codes for executive officers and directors must be submitted to the Chair of the WMIH audit committee and may be made only by the Board. The WMIH audit committee monitors certain key risks, such as risk associated with internal
control over financial reporting, liquidity risk and risks associated with potential business acquisitions, in addition to assessing the risks in WMIH&#146;s proposed financing or investments. The WMIH compensation committee assesses risks created
by the incentives inherent in WMIH&#146;s compensation policies. Finally, the full Board reviews strategic and operational risk in the context of reports from the management team and the committees of the Board. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are held by two different individuals. The Board has determined that during his tenure,
Mr.&nbsp;Scheiwe has been independent under the NASDAQ listing standards. The Board believes that this structure is appropriate for WMIH at this time. Except for the WMIH CS&amp;D committee, on which Mr.&nbsp;Olson and Mr.&nbsp;Gallagher serve, each
of WMIH&#146;s board committees is made up solely of independent directors and sets its own agenda. The independent directors also meet in executive session on a regular basis without management present. </P>

is applicable to the Board and officers, including WMIH&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Controller. The WMIH code of ethics focuses on honest and ethical conduct, the adequacy of
disclosure in WMIH&#146;s financial reports, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. A current copy of the code of ethics is available on WMIH&#146;s website at www.wmih-corp.com, and is administered by the WMIH audit committee. </P>

Officer and Secretary, WMIH Corp., 800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 4100, Seattle, Washington 98104. Such communications will be forwarded unopened to the individual serving as Chairman of the Board, who will be responsible for responding to or forwarding
such communications as appropriate, including communications directed to individual directors or board committees. Communications will not be forwarded if the Chairman of the Board determines that they do not appear to be within the scope of the
Board&#146;s (or such other intended recipient&#146;s) responsibilities or are otherwise inappropriate or frivolous. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Section&nbsp;16(a) Beneficial

objectives of the 2017 executive compensation programs established by the WMIH compensation committee were to retain executive officers and employees capable of: (a)&nbsp;identifying and assessing potential acquisition opportunities;

Gallagher and Thomas L. Fairfield were appointed as WMIH&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, respectively, with the expectation that Messrs. Gallagher and Fairfield would serve integral roles in assessing potential
acquisitions on behalf of WMIH. As discussed further below, a significant portion of the compensation provided to Messrs. Gallagher and Fairfield is linked to WMIH&#146;s successful completion of an acquisition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At WMIH&#146;s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, 77% of the stockholders who voted on the advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation (excluding

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The WMIH compensation committee is responsible for the oversight of WMIH&#146;s executive compensation program. Each director who served on the WMIH
compensation committee in 2017 was, and each current member of the WMIH compensation committee is, a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> director within the meaning of SEC Rule <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">16b-3,</FONT> an
outside director within the meaning of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code and an independent director under NASDAQ listing standards. The WMIH compensation committee&#146;s purpose is to discharge the Board&#146;s responsibilities relating to
compensation of WMIH&#146;s executive officers and to adopt policies that govern WMIH&#146;s compensation and benefit programs in a manner that supports both WMIH&#146;s short and long term business strategies. The WMIH compensation committee has
overall responsibility for approving and evaluating WMIH&#146;s executive officer compensation plans, policies and programs. The WMIH compensation committee may delegate authority to subcommittees, retain or terminate compensation consultants and
obtain advice and assistance from internal or external legal, accounting or other advisers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Role of WMIH Compensation Committee Consultants in
Compensation Decisions </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under its charter, the WMIH compensation committee may periodically engage independent compensation consultants to provide
assistance and advice as it discharges its responsibilities under its written charter. The duties of compensation consultants engaged by the WMIH compensation committee may include periodically reviewing WMIH&#146;s compensation programs to confirm
that they are consistent with the executive compensation philosophy and objectives established by the WMIH compensation committee. Compensation consultants may also advise the WMIH compensation committee on emerging trends and issues related to the
compensation of executive officers and directors and provide recommendations on the appropriate composition of peer group and market data sources to be used by the WMIH compensation committee as reference points for executive compensation decisions.
In 2017, the WMIH compensation committee did not retain the services of an independent third party compensation consultant. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Elements of Compensation

did not conduct a specific analysis of compensation of executives at peer companies in setting the base salaries for the named executive officers; however, based on the experience and general industry knowledge of the Board members and the WMIH

</I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&nbsp;9, 2018, WMIH entered into the Amendment of the Gallagher employment agreement (as defined below) (which we refer to as the
&#147;Gallagher Amendment&#148;) and the Amendment of the Fairfield employment agreement (as defined below) (which we refer to as the &#147;Fairfield Amendment&#148; and, together with the Gallagher Amendment, which we refer to as the
&#147;Amendments&#148;). The Amendments, which were approved by the Board and its compensation committee, amend each of the Gallagher employment agreement and the Fairfield employment agreement, by extending the terms of each of
Mr.&nbsp;Gallagher&#146;s and Mr.&nbsp;Fairfield&#146;s employment with WMIH until the earlier of (a)&nbsp;the closing date of the Merger or (b)&nbsp;the end date (as defined in the Amendments). Except as modified by the Amendments, all other terms
and conditions of each of the Gallagher employment agreement and Fairfield employment agreement remain in full force and effect. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, in
connection with the Merger, WMIH may award cash compensation, not to exceed $4,250,000 in the aggregate, to certain of its officers and employees, including the named executive officers, which may be paid as bonuses, severance payments or other
forms of retention or incentive payments. As of the date of this Amendment, no such cash compensation has been awarded to any of WMIH&#146;s officers and employees. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Deductibility of Executive Compensation </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code generally limits the federal corporate income tax deduction for compensation paid by a public company to its Chief Executive
Officer and certain other executive officers to $1&nbsp;million in the year the compensation becomes taxable to the executive, unless the compensation is &#147;performance-based compensation&#148; or qualifies under certain other exceptions.
Pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, as of January&nbsp;1, 2018, the exception under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code for qualified performance-based compensation was eliminated and the definition of &#147;covered employee&#148; was
expanded to include the chief financial officer of a Company. No executive was paid an amount in 2017 where this provision would have been applicable. The WMIH compensation committee intends to seek to qualify executive compensation for
deductibility under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code to the extent consistent with WMIH&#146;s best interests. Since corporate objectives may not always be consistent with the requirements for full deductibility, it is conceivable that WMIH may enter
into compensation arrangements in the future under which payments are not deductible under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. Deductibility will not be the sole factor used by the WMIH compensation committee in ascertaining appropriate levels or modes
of compensation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Compensation Recovery Policy </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">WMIH
does not have any incentive based compensation tied to performance at this time. Therefore, WMIH has not implemented a policy regarding retroactive adjustments to any cash or incentive compensation paid to WMIH&#146;s executive officers and other
employees where the payments were predicated upon the achievement of financial results that were subsequently the subject of a financial restatement. WMIH&#146;s compensation committee intends to adopt a general compensation recovery (or clawback)
policy covering WMIH&#146;s annual and long-term incentive award plans and arrangements after the SEC adopts final rules implementing the requirement of Section&nbsp;954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. In addition,
if WMIH is required to restate WMIH&#146;s financial results due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws, WMIH&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer may be legally
required to reimburse WMIH for any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation they receive pursuant to the provisions of Section&nbsp;304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. </P>

in connection with WMIH&#146;s operations and future strategic plans. The 2012 Plan provides for the granting of restricted shares and other cash and share based awards. The value of WMIH restricted stock is determined using the fair market value of

the 2012 Plan was increased from 2,000,000 shares to 3,000,000 shares, and that modified the terms under which the 2012 Plan may be amended to permit such an increase through action of the Board except when shareholder approval is necessary to
comply with any applicable law, regulation or rule of any stock exchange on which WMIH&#146;s shares are listed, quoted or traded. On February&nbsp;25, 2015, the Board approved and adopted a Second Amendment to the 2012 Plan, pursuant to which the
number of shares of WMIH Common Stock authorized and available for grants under the 2012 Plan was increased from 3,000,000 shares to 12,000,000 shares, subject to approval of stockholders of WMIH, which approval was subsequently received on

compensation committee. The 2012 Plan authorizes the WMIH compensation committee to designate participants to receive awards, to determine the type of awards and the times when awards are to be granted to participants, to determine the number of
awards to be granted and the number of shares of WMIH Common Stock to which an award will relate, to determine the terms and conditions of any award, to determine to what extent an award may be settled or its exercise paid in cash, shares of WMIH
Common Stock, other awards or other property, or whether an award may be canceled, forfeited, exchanged or surrendered, to prescribe the form of each award agreement, to decide all other matters in connection with an award, and to interpret the 2012
Plan and establish rules and regulations relating to the 2012 Plan. The 2012 Plan authorizes the WMIH compensation committee to delegate its authority as permitted by law and the rules of any established securities market on which WMIH Common Stock
is traded, except that only the Board or the WMIH compensation committee may approve awards to individuals who are subject to section 16 of the Exchange Act or who are a &#147;covered employee&#148; under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. </P>

rights or WMIH performance-based awards. All awards are evidenced by an award agreement and may be granted alone or in tandem with other awards. Each award agreement will include recapture or clawback provisions to the extent the WMIH compensation
committee believes desirable or necessary to comply with applicable law in effect on the date of the award agreement, or as it otherwise determines to be appropriate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A WMIH
restricted stock award consists of shares of WMIH Common Stock that generally are <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-transferable</FONT> and subject to other restrictions imposed by the WMIH compensation committee, including, for example,
restrictions on the right to receive dividends or vote the shares. Restrictions on WMIH restricted stock may lapse separately or in combination, at such times, in such circumstances, in installments or otherwise as determined by the WMIH
compensation committee at the time of grant or thereafter. Participants may not exercise voting rights with respect to WMIH restricted stock unless otherwise provided in the award agreement. If a participant terminates employment or service during
the restricted period, then any unvested WMIH restricted stock will be forfeited except as otherwise provided in the award agreement. The WMIH compensation committee may waive any restrictions or forfeiture conditions relating to a WMIH restricted
stock award. Any certificates representing shares of WMIH restricted stock that are registered in a participant&#146;s name will bear an appropriate legend referring to the applicable terms, conditions and restrictions, and may be retained in
WMIH&#146;s possession until all applicable restrictions have lapsed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A WMIH restricted stock unit award represents the right to receive a specified
number of shares of WMIH Common Stock, or a cash payment equal to the fair market value as of a specified date of a specified number of shares of WMIH Common Stock, subject to any vesting or other restrictions deemed appropriate by the WMIH
compensation committee. Restrictions on WMIH restricted stock units may lapse separately or in combination, at such times, in such circumstances, in installments or otherwise as determined by the WMIH compensation committee at the time of grant or
thereafter. If a participant terminates employment or services during the restricted period, then any units that are at that time subject to restrictions will be forfeited except as otherwise provided in the award agreement. The WMIH compensation
committee may waive any restrictions or forfeiture conditions relating to a WMIH restricted stock award. Payment for WMIH restricted stock units will be made at the time designated by the WMIH compensation committee in the award agreement, and may
be in the form of cash or shares of WMIH Common Stock, or in a combination of both, as provided by the WMIH compensation committee in the applicable award agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Stock Grant and Stock Unit Awards </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 2012 Plan permits
the WMIH compensation committee to grant WMIH stock grant awards and WMIH stock unit awards. A WMIH stock grant award is the right to receive or purchase at a price determined by the WMIH compensation committee a specified number of shares of WMIH
Common Stock free of any vesting restrictions. The purchase price, if any, for a WMIH stock grant award is payable in cash or other form of consideration acceptable to the WMIH compensation committee. A WMIH stock unit award represents the right to
receive in the future a specified number of shares of WMIH Common Stock, or a cash payment equal to the fair market value as of a specified date of a specified number of shares of WMIH Common Stock, free of any vesting restrictions. WMIH stock grant
awards and WMIH stock unit awards may be granted in respect of past services or other valid consideration, or in lieu of any cash compensation due to a participant. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Performance Share, Performance Share Unit and Performance Cash Awards </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the 2012 Plan, the WMIH compensation committee may grant WMIH performance share awards, WMIH performance share unit awards and WMIH performance cash
awards. A WMIH performance share award grants a participant the right to receive a specified number of shares of WMIH Common Stock depending on the satisfaction of any one or more performance goals. A WMIH performance share unit award grants a
participant the right to receive a specified number of shares of WMIH Common Stock, a cash payment equal to the fair market value as of a specified date of a specified number of shares, or a combination of shares and cash, depending on the
satisfaction of any one or more performance goals. A WMIH performance cash award grants a participant the right to receive an amount of cash depending on the satisfaction of any one or more performance goals. Performance in each case may be measured
on a specified date or dates or over any period or periods determined by the WMIH compensation committee. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The WMIH compensation committee will establish the performance goals for each award of WMIH performance shares,
WMIH performance share units or WMIH performance cash, which will be based on performance criteria designated in the award agreement. Such performance goals may be expressed in terms of overall company performance or the performance of a division,
business unit, plant or an individual. Performance goals may be stated in terms of absolute levels or relative to another company or companies or to an index or indices. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Dividend Equivalent Awards </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A WMIH dividend equivalent
award represents the right to receive a payment based on the dividends declared on the shares of WMIH Common Stock that are subject to any WMIH restricted stock unit, WMIH stock unit, WMIH performance share unit or WMIH performance share award, to
be credited on dividend payment dates during the period between the grant date and the date the award is settled, vests or expires, as determined by the WMIH compensation committee. A WMIH dividend equivalent award is expressed in terms of cash or
shares of WMIH Common Stock depending on the way in which the dividends to which it relates are declared. The award will be converted to cash or additional shares of WMIH Common Stock, as the case may be, by such formula and at such time and subject
to such limitations as determined by the WMIH compensation committee, and may be paid with interest if so provided in the award agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Stock
Options </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 2012 Plan provides for awards of options to purchase shares of WMIH Common Stock that are either &#147;incentive stock options&#148;,
meaning they are intended to satisfy the requirements of Section&nbsp;422 of the Code, or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;non-qualified</FONT> stock options&#148;, which are not intended to satisfy the requirements of Section&nbsp;422 of the
Code. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Stock Appreciation Rights </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 2012 Plan
provides for awards of WMIH stock appreciation rights, which generally would entitle the holder to receive, upon settlement, the excess of the fair market value of a share of WMIH Common Stock on the exercise date over the exercise price, multiplied
by the number of shares for which the right is exercised. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Performance-Based Awards </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A WMIH performance-based award is an award intended to qualify as &#147;performance-based compensation&#148; under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. The 2012
Plan is designed to permit the WMIH compensation committee to qualify any award granted to an employee who is or may be a covered employee under Code Section&nbsp;162(m) as a WMIH performance-based award. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Change of Control </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Unless otherwise provided in an award
agreement by the WMIH compensation committee, with the approval of the Board, if there is a change of control of WMIH (as defined in the 2012 Plan), restrictions on any WMIH restricted stock or WMIH restricted stock unit awards will lapse, any WMIH
performance share or WMIH performance share unit awards that are payable in WMIH Common Stock will be converted to fully vested WMIH stock grants, WMIH performance share unit awards that are payable in cash will be fully vested and WMIH performance
cash awards will be deemed satisfied and earned at the target performance level. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Adjustments </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 2012 Plan provides that in the event of certain corporate events or changes in WMIH Common Stock, the WMIH compensation committee will proportionally
adjust awards and the number of shares under the 2012 Plan as it determines to be appropriate. Any adjustment to awards will be made in a manner consistent with Code Section&nbsp;409A. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Amendments and Termination </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 2012 Plan will terminate
on May&nbsp;22, 2022, unless it is terminated sooner by the WMIH compensation committee with the approval of the Board. The WMIH compensation committee may terminate or amend the 2012 Plan in any respect at any time, except that no amendment may be
made without shareholder approval if such approval is required by applicable law, regulation or rule of any stock exchange on which WMIH Common Stock is listed, quoted or traded. Except as otherwise provided in the 2012 Plan with respect to
adjustments in connection with certain corporate events or changes in WMIH Common Stock, no amendment may be made that would adversely affect the rights of a holder of any outstanding award without the holder&#146;s written consent. However, holder
consent is not needed for any change required by law or regulation, required to cause awards to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section&nbsp;162(m) or to comply with Code Section&nbsp;409A, or that in the WMIH compensation
committee&#146;s good faith discretion does not adversely affect in any material way the rights of the holder. </P>

employment may not be terminated for &#147;Cause&#148; within the meaning of clauses (iv)&nbsp;and (v)&nbsp;above unless WMIH has given him written notice stating the basis for such termination and Mr.&nbsp;Fairfield is given fifteen (15)&nbsp;days
to cure, to the extent curable, the neglect or conduct that is the basis of any such claim. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For purposes of the Fairfield employment agreement,
&#147;Good Reason&#148; means Mr.&nbsp;Fairfield&#146;s voluntary resignation after WMIH takes any of the following actions taken without Mr.&nbsp;Fairfield&#146;s written consent: (i)&nbsp;any material failure by WMIH to fulfill WMIH&#146;s
obligations under the Fairfield employment agreement, (ii)&nbsp;a material and adverse change to, or a material reduction of, Mr.&nbsp;Fairfield&#146;s duties and responsibilities to WMIH, (iii)&nbsp;a reduction in Mr.&nbsp;Fairfield&#146;s then
current annual base salary, or (iv)&nbsp;the failure of any successor to all or substantially all of WMIH&#146;s assets to assume the Fairfield employment agreement, whether in writing or by operation of law; provided, that any such event will not
constitute Good Reason unless and until Mr.&nbsp;Fairfield has provided WMIH with written notice. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the Fairfield Restricted Stock Agreement,
the 1,777,778 restricted shares awarded to Mr.&nbsp;Fairfield will only vest in full upon the consummation of a Qualifying Acquisition if Mr.&nbsp;Fairfield continues to be employed by WMIH until such time. However, if WMIH consummates a Qualifying
Acquisition within six months following a termination of Mr.&nbsp;Fairfield&#146;s employment by WMIH without Cause, due to Mr.&nbsp;Fairfield&#146;s resignation for Good Reason, as a result of Mr.&nbsp;Fairfield&#146;s death or disability or due to
the expiration of the employment term, then the 1,777,778 restricted shares will vest at the time of the consummation of the Qualifying Acquisition. The completion of the Merger will constitute a Qualifying Acquisition for purposes of the Fairfield
Restricted Stock Agreement. The value of the accelerated vesting of the 1,777,778 restricted shares under either circumstance, assuming such event occurred on December&nbsp;31, 2017, would have been $1,511,111 (based on the closing price of WMIH
Common Stock as of December&nbsp;29, 2017, the last trading day of 2017, which was $0.85). Assuming Mr.&nbsp;Fairfield was entitled to receive an additional grant of restricted stock pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement, the value of
the accelerated vesting of the maximum number of shares (an aggregate of 2,285,714 restricted shares), assuming such event occurred on December&nbsp;31, 2017, would have been $1,942,857 (based on the closing price of WMIH Common Stock as of

retainers based on committee chair positions and committee membership; and (3)&nbsp;annual and/or special restricted stock grants. The annual cash retainer for board service is $100,000. Annual retainers for committee or chair service include:
(i)&nbsp;$10,000 for each <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-chair</FONT> member of the WMIH audit committee; (ii)&nbsp;$10,000 for each <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-Chair</FONT> member of the WMIH CS&amp;D committee; (iii)&nbsp;$5,000 for

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2013, the Board, upon recommendation of the WMIH compensation committee, adopted a policy that the annual restricted stock grant to directors will, subject

of WMIH&#146;s annual meeting of stockholders, at a stock price equal to the closing price of WMIH Common Stock as quoted on the exchange on which shares of WMIH Common Stock trade on the grant date. Generally, grants of restricted stock to
WMIH&#146;s directors vest in three equal installments over a three year period, subject to continued service as a director through the vesting dates. On June&nbsp;1, 2017, Messrs. Renoff, Scheiwe and Willingham and Ms.&nbsp;Glossman each received a
grant of 83,333 shares of restricted stock, with each such grant having a fair market value of $1.20 per share as of the grant date. The shares of restricted stock vest over a period of three years, with

2012. Each of these agreements was approved by WMMRC&#146;s primary regulator. Total amounts incurred and paid under these agreements totaled $1.4&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The expense and
related income eliminate on consolidation. These agreements are described below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of such Investment Management Agreement, WMIH receives
from WMMRC a monthly fee equal to the product of (x)&nbsp;the ending dollar amount of assets under management during the calendar month in question and (y)&nbsp;0.002 divided by 12. WMIH is responsible for investing the funds of WMMRC based on
applicable investment criteria and subject to rules and regulations to which WMMRC is subject. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of such Administrative Services Agreement,
WMIH receives from WMMRC a fee of $110,000 per month. WMIH is responsible for providing administrative services to support, among other things, supervision, governance, financial administration and reporting, risk management and claims management as
may be necessary, together with such other general or specific administrative services that may be reasonably required or requested by WMMRC in the ordinary course of its business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Transition Services Agreement </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&nbsp;22, 2012,
WMIH and the Trust entered into the transition services agreement. Pursuant to the transition services agreement, the Trust makes available certain services and employees to WMIH, including the services of Charles Edward Smith who is WMIH&#146;s
Chief Legal Officer and Secretary. Since becoming effect, the transition services agreement has been amended from time to time in order to address, among other things, adjustments to the services provided thereunder; extensions of the effectiveness
thereof; adjustments to hourly rates charged thereunder; and other matters. The transition services agreement, as amended, remains in effect as of the date hereof, subject to automatic, three-month renewal periods, subject to <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-renewal</FONT> at the end of any additional term upon written notice by either party at least 30 days prior to the expiration of any particular additional term. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust was established as part of the Bankruptcy Plan. The Trust emerged on the effective date of the Bankruptcy Plan and was formed for the purpose of
holding, managing and administering the &#147;Liquidating Trust Assets&#148; (as defined in the Bankruptcy Plan) on behalf of the Trust&#146;s beneficiaries, and distributing the proceeds thereof to such beneficiaries. The Trust is managed by a
trustee, William Kosturos, and a Trust Advisory Board. Michael L. Willingham, a member of WMIH&#146;s board, a member of WMIH audit committee and a member of WMIH compensation committee, is also a member of the Trust Advisory Board. For services
provided under the transition services agreement, WMIH paid the Trust approximately $806,645, of which $523,688 was paid for the services of Mr.&nbsp;Smith, approximately $633,051 in 2016, of which $387,788 was paid for the services of
Mr.&nbsp;Smith, and approximately $835,565 in 2015, of which $495,716 was paid for the services of Mr. Smith. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the transition services
agreement, the Trust previously provided WMIH with office space for its employees and other basic infrastructural and support services to facilitate WMIH&#146;s operations. In June 2015, WMIH moved into new office space and now pays for such office
space directly at an average rate of approximately $5,700 per month. WMIH pays the Trust a monthly overhead charge of approximately $6,122 relating to general support services, technology services and the use of supplies and equipment. For fees
relating to the general support services, technology services and the use of supplies and equipment, WMIH paid the Trust approximately $55,164, $55,164 and $60,714 during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. </P>

equal to fifty percent (50%)&nbsp;of the Litigation Proceeds such creditor otherwise would have received. &#147;Litigation Proceeds&#148; is defined in the Bankruptcy Plan, in relevant part, as the recoveries, net of related legal fees and other
expenses, of the Trust on account of causes of action against third parties and includes Recovery Claims (as defined in the Bankruptcy Plan). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">WMIH is
aware that on or about October&nbsp;14, 2014, the Trust filed a lawsuit in King County Superior Court in the State of Washington against 16 former directors and officers of WMI (the &#147;D&amp;O Litigation&#148;). The Trust&#146;s complaint
alleges, among other things, that the defendants named therein breached their fiduciary duties to WMI and committed corporate waste and fraud by squandering WMI&#146;s financial resources. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;1, 2014, the Trust filed its<I></I><I>&nbsp;Motion of WMI Liquidating Trust for an Order, Pursuant to Sections</I><I></I><I>&nbsp;105(a) and
362 of the Bankruptcy Code and Rule 9019 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, (A)</I><I></I><I>&nbsp;Approving Settlement Agreement Between WMI Liquidating Trust, Certain Directors and Officers and Insurers and
(B)</I><I></I><I>&nbsp;Authorizing and Directing the Consummation Thereof</I>&nbsp;(as amended, modified or supplemented prior to the date hereof, the &#147;D&amp;O Settlement Motion&#148;). Among other things, the D&amp;O Settlement Motion sought
approval of a settlement among the Trust, certain former directors and officers of WMI and certain insurance carriers that underwrote director and officer liability insurance policies for the benefit of WMI and its affiliates (including such former
directors and officers). At a hearing held on December&nbsp;23, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Trust&#146;s D&amp;O Settlement Motion. On January&nbsp;5, 2015, certain <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-settling</FONT> officers appealed
the Bankruptcy Court&#146;s order granting the D&amp;O Settlement Motion. In connection with the settlement of the D&amp;O Litigation, including the appeal thereof by such <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-settling</FONT> officers, in May 2015,
the Trust, such <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-settling</FONT> officers and certain insurance carriers entered into a Reserve Settlement Agreement (&#147;RSA&#148;) to settle the D&amp;O Litigation, including the appeal thereof. Pursuant to
the terms of the RSA, the parties agreed, among other things, that $3.0&nbsp;million of the $37.0&nbsp;million that had been required to be paid to the Trust pursuant to the settlement, would be placed into a segregated reserve account (the
&#147;RSA Reserve&#148;) to be administered by a third party. Under the RSA, funds are released from the RSA Reserve to the Trust if and when certain designated conditions are satisfied. If and when these funds are released to the Trust, and to the
extent WMIH is entitled to receive such funds in accordance with the Plan, it is anticipated that the Trust will make payments to WMIH in an amount equal to WMIH&#146;s share of Litigation Proceeds as provided under the Plan. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, WMIH received approximately $7.8&nbsp;million representing its share of the net Litigation Proceeds related to
the settlement of the D&amp;O Litigation. In September 2016 and September 2017, WMIH was informed that approximately $0.5&nbsp;million of Litigation Proceeds was released from the RSA Reserve pursuant to the terms of the RSA, and that WMIH would
receive approximately $123,000, for each year, of the released Litigation Proceeds, representing WMIH&#146;s portion of the second and third distributions of $0.5&nbsp;million from the initial $3.0&nbsp;million of Litigation Proceeds held in the RSA
Reserve. As of March&nbsp;31, 2018, approximately $1.5&nbsp;million remains on deposit in the RSA Reserve. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Due to the contingent nature of future
distributions from the RSA Reserve, there can be no assurance that WMIH will receive any distributions from the remaining balance in the segregated reserve account in the future. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, WMIH had not received any Litigation
Proceeds, other than as described above, and there can be no assurance that WMIH will receive any distributions on account of Litigation Proceeds in the future. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">WMIH has adopted and maintains a Related Person Transaction Policy. The Related Person Transaction Policy is intended to ensure fairness in any transaction
with WMIH that may occur when WMIH&#146;s directors, executive officers and/or certain stockholders are involved (&#147;related person&#148;). When a related person becomes involved in a transaction or when the Chief Legal Officer of WMIH becomes
aware of a potential transaction, several steps of analysis are to be undertaken to review, approve and/or ratify any such transaction. The Chief Legal Officer of WMIH is responsible for determining whether the transaction in question rises to the
level of a related person transaction as defined by the Related Person Transaction Policy. If it is, then the Chief Legal Officer of WMIH also is required to determine whether such transaction requires disclosure in WMIH&#146;s annual proxy
statement or annual report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K,</FONT> as the case may be. The transaction in question is then either reported to the WMIH audit committee as approved or provided to the WMIH audit committee (or directly to
the Chair if time is of essence) for further examination, and if appropriate, approval or ratification. </P>
