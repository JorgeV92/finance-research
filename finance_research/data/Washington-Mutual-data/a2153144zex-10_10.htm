determination after appeal of the claim. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of this Section&nbsp;8, a "claim" means a written request for Plan benefits filed with the Plan Administrator. A mere inquiry or request for information shall not

to the Plan Administrator for a review of the denied claim. The appeal must be made in writing within sixty (60)&nbsp;days of the Plan administrator's initial notice of adverse benefit
determination, or a Participant will lose the right to appeal the denial. Failure to make a timely appeal will result in forfeiture of the right to file suit in court, as a Participant will have
failed to exhaust internal administrative appeal rights, which is generally a prerequisite to bringing suit. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
written appeal should state the reasons that the Participant believes the claim should not have been denied and should cite specific provisions of the Plan that support that claim.
It should include any additional facts and/or documents that support the claim. The Participant may also ask additional questions and make written comments, and may review (on request and at no
charge) documents and other information relevant to the appeal. The Plan Administrator will review all written comment submitted with the appeal. </FONT></P>

longer than sixty (60)&nbsp;days after it is submitted and will notify a Participant of its decision in writing. The individual who decides the appeal will not be the same individual who decided the
initial claim denial and will not be that individual's subordinate. If the decision on appeal affirms the initial denial of the claim, the Participant will be furnished with a notice of adverse
benefit determination on review setting forth: </FONT></P>

the Plan Administrator relied on an "internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion" in making the decision, a description of the specific rule,
