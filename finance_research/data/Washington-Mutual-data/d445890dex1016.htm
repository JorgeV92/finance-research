non-employee directors has three components: (1)&nbsp;annual cash retainer for board service, (2)&nbsp;annual cash retainers based on committee chair positions or committee memberships, and (3)&nbsp;annual restricted stock grant. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The annual cash retainer for board service is $100,000. Retainers for committee or chair service include: (i)&nbsp;$10,000 for each non-Chair member of
the Audit Committee; (ii)&nbsp;$10,000 for each non-Chair member of the Corporate Strategy and Development Committee; (iii)&nbsp;$5,000 for each non-Chair member of the Compensation Committee; (iv)&nbsp;$50,000 for the Board of Directors Chair;
(v)&nbsp;$25,000 for the Audit Committee Chair; (vi)&nbsp;$25,000 for the Corporate Strategy and Development Committee Chair; and (vii)&nbsp;$12,500 for the Compensation Committee Chair. All retainers are paid in quarterly installments in advance on
the first day of the quarter. For calendar year 2012, all retainers were prorated based on the board service commencement date of March&nbsp;19, 2012. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Each non-employee director also receives an annual restricted stock grant issued pursuant to the Company&#146;s 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;). In 2012, the value of the annual
restricted stock grant was $100,000, which was prorated based on the board service commencement date of March&nbsp;19, 2012. The number of shares in the grant is based on the fair market value of the Company&#146;s common stock as of the grant date.
The restricted stock grant vests in three equal installments on March&nbsp;19 of each year over a three year period, subject to continued service as a director through the vesting dates. The shares also immediately vest in the event of a Change of
Control, as defined in the Plan. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Directors are subject to stock ownership guidelines that require that the director must at all times during
service on the board hold shares of the Company&#146;s stock equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares awarded to the director as director compensation and that have vested. To monitor the guideline, board members are not permitted to sell
shares without Compensation Committee approval. </FONT></P>
