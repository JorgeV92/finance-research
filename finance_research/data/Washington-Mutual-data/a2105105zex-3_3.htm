the law of such person, or from conduct of the person in violation of RCW 23B.08.310, or from or on account of any transaction with respect to which it is finally adjudged that such person personally
received a benefit in money, property, or services to which such person was not legally entitled, and (b)&nbsp;except as provided in subsection 8.3 with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce
rights to indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding
(or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors of the corporation. Such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director and shall inure to the benefit of his
or her heirs, executors and administrators. If the Washington Business Corporation Act is amended to authorize further indemnification of directors, then directors of the corporation shall be
indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by the Washington Business Corporation Act, as so amended. </FONT></P>

reimbursement or advancement of expenses to the claimant is proper in the
