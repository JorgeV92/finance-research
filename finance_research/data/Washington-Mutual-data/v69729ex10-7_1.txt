        THIS AMENDMENT to the Washington Mutual Restricted Stock Plan As Amended

                                    RECITALS

        WHEREAS, Washington Mutual, Inc. (the "Company") maintains the Plan for
the benefit of eligible employees; and

        WHEREAS, the Company desires to amend the Plan to add additional
business criteria on which performance goals may be based, to provide that
performance goals shall exclude transaction-related expense unless otherwise
determined by the Compensation Committee in selecting performance goals, and to
make certain other clarifying changes; and

        WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 10.6 of the Plan the Directors'
Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the Company is authorized to amend
the Plan;

        NOW, THEREFORE, the Plan is hereby amended as follows:

        1. Sections 6.6(c) and (d) of the Plan be, and they hereby are, amended
and restated in their entirety, effective January 18, 2000, to read as set forth
below, subject to shareholder approval:

                (c) BUSINESS CRITERIA ON WHICH PERFORMANCE GOALS SHALL BE BASED.
        The lapse of restrictions on Awards granted under this Section 6.6 shall
        be based on the Company's attainment of performance goals based on one
        or more of the following business criteria:

                Return on average common equity.

                Return on average equity.

                Efficiency ratio (other expense as a percentage of other income
                plus net interest income), either before or after amortization
                of intangible assets (goodwill).

                Net operating expense (other income less other expense), either
                before or after amortization of intangible assets (goodwill).

                Earnings per diluted share of common stock.

                Operating earnings (earnings before transaction-related expense)
                per diluted share of common stock, either before or after
                amortization of intangible assets (goodwill).

                Operating earnings per diluted share of common stock before
                depreciation and amortization.

                Return on average assets.

                Ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets.

        These business criteria shall be construed consistent with the use of
        the same terms in Washington Mutual's published financial statements.
        All business criteria other than earnings per diluted share of common
        stock shall exclude transaction-related expense unless otherwise
        determined by the Compensation Committee in selecting the business
        criteria for a particular Award pursuant to Section 6.6(d) below. In
        selecting any business criteria other than earnings per diluted share of
        common stock, the Compensation Committee may elect, pursuant to Section
        6.6(d) below, to exclude amortization of intangible assets (goodwill),
        or to exclude depreciation and amortization.

                (d) ESTABLISHING PERFORMANCE GOALS. The Compensation Committee
        shall establish, for each Award granted under this Section 6.6: (i) the
        measurement period(s) to which the performance goals will be applied,
        (ii) the specific business criterion or criteria, or combination
        thereof, that will be used; (iii) the specific performance targets that
        will be used for the selected business criterion or criteria; (iv) any
        special adjustments that will be applied in calculating whether the
        performance targets have been met to factor out extraordinary items, and
        (v) the formula for calculating the lapse of restrictions in relation to
        the performance targets. These determinations shall be set out in the
        Agreement for each Award. Except as otherwise permitted under Section
        162(m) of the Code, each Award under this Section 6.6 shall be granted
        no later than 90 days after the start of any applicable measurement
        period, on or before the date that 25 percent of each applicable
        measurement period has elapsed, and while the outcome is substantially
        uncertain.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned, an authorized officer of the
Company, has executed this amendment on the day and year first written above.



                                            WASHINGTON MUTUAL, INC.


                                            By:________________________________
