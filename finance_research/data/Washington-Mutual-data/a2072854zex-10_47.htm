<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such
notice shall be accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price by certified or bank check or such other instrument as the Company may accept. If approved by the Committee,
payment, in full or in part, may also be made in the form of unrestricted Common Stock already owned by the optionee of the same class as the Common Stock subject to the Stock Option (based on the
Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the Stock Option is exercised). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the discretion of the Committee, payment for any shares subject to a Stock Option may also be made by delivering a properly executed exercise notice to the Company, together with a
copy of irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds necessary to pay the purchase price and any federal, state, local or foreign
withholding taxes. To facilitate the foregoing, the Company may enter into agreements for coordinated procedures with one or more brokerage firms. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
shares of Common Stock shall be issued until full payment therefor has been made. An optionee shall have all of the rights of a shareholder of the Company holding the class or series
of Common Stock that is subject to such Stock Option (including, if applicable, the right to vote the shares and the right to receive dividends), when the optionee has given written notice of
exercise, has paid in full for such shares and, if requested, has given the representation described in Section&nbsp;13(a). </FONT></P>

members, whether directly or indirectly or by means of a trust or partnership or otherwise or (y)&nbsp;a domestic relations order or qualified domestic relations order as such terms are defined by
the Code or ERISA. All Stock Options shall be exercisable, subject to the terms of this Plan, only by the optionee, the guardian or legal representative of the optionee, or any person to whom such
option is transferred pursuant to the preceding sentence, it being understood that the term "holder" and "optionee" include such guardian, legal representative and other transferee. </FONT></P>

such other period as the Committee may specify in the option agreement) from the date of such death or until the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Option, whichever period is the shorter. </FONT></P>

as the Committee may determine, for a period of three years (or such shorter period as the Committee may specify in the option agreement) from the date of such termination of employment or until the
expiration of the stated term of such Stock Option, whichever period is the shorter; provided, however, that if the optionee dies within such period, any unexercised Stock Option held by such optionee
shall, notwithstanding the expiration of such period, continue to be exercisable to the extent to which it was exercisable at the time of death for a period of 12&nbsp;months from the date of such
