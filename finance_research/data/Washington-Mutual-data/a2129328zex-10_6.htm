of Stock to another brokerage account of the Participant's choosing or request that a stock certificate be issued and delivered to him or her. Dividends paid in the form of shares of Stock with
respect to Stock in a Participant's account shall be credited to such account. A Participant who is not subject to payment of U.S. income taxes may move his or her shares of Stock to another brokerage

following the date of filing the amended Subscription, provided the amended Subscription is filed prior to any date required by the Plan Administrator. If not filed prior to such date, the change in
rate shall be effective as of the beginning of the next succeeding payroll period. All Payroll Deductions accrued by a Participant as of such effective date shall continue to be applied toward the

Administrator at least ten days prior to such Purchase Period in such form and in accordance with such terms as the Plan Administrator may establish for an Offering. An amended Subscription shall

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Offering then in progress shall be shortened by setting a new Purchase Date and shall
terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed dissolution or liquidation, unless provided otherwise by the Board or the Committee. The new Purchase Date shall be a specified date
before the date of the Company's proposed dissolution or liquidation. The Board shall notify each Participant in writing prior to the new Purchase Date that the Purchase Date for the Participant's
Option has been changed to the new Purchase Date and that the Participant's Option shall be exercised automatically on the new Purchase Date, unless prior to such date the Participant has withdrawn
from the Plan as provided in Section&nbsp;11. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, separation, reorganization or liquidation of the Company, as a result of which the shareholders of
the Company receive cash, stock or other property in exchange for their shares of Stock (a "Company Transaction"), each outstanding Option shall be assumed or an equivalent option substituted by the
successor company or parent thereof (the "Successor Company"). In the event that the Successor Company refuses to assume or substitute for the Option, any Offering then in progress shall be shortened
by setting a new Purchase Date. The new Purchase Date shall be a specified date before the date of the Company Transaction. The Plan Administrator shall notify each Participant in writing, prior to
the new Purchase Date, that the Purchase Date for the Participant's Option has been changed to the new Purchase Date and that the Participant's Option shall be exercised automatically on the new
Purchase Date, unless prior to such date the Participant has withdrawn from the Plan as provided in Section&nbsp;11. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grant of Options shall in no way affect the Company's right to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver any shares of Stock under the Plan or make any other

securities laws, any shares of Stock, security or interest in a security paid or issued under, or created by, the Plan, or to continue in effect any such registrations or qualifications if made. The
Company may issue certificates for shares with such legends and subject to such restrictions on transfer and stop-transfer instructions as counsel for the Company deems necessary or
desirable for compliance by the Company with federal and state securities laws. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
the extent that the Plan or any instrument evidencing shares of Stock provides for issuance of stock certificates to reflect the issuance of such shares, the issuance may be effected
on a noncertificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange. </FONT></P>
