(1)    As defined in Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K.

(2)    The preferred dividends were increased to amounts representing the pretax earning that would be
       required to cover such dividend requirements.

(3)    These computations are included herein in compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission
       Regulations.  However, management believes that fixed charge ratios are not meaningful measures for the
       business of the Company because of  two factors.  First, even if there were no change in net income, the
       ratios would decline with an increase in the proportion of income which is tax-exempt or, conversely,
       they would increase with a decrease in the proportion of income which is tax-exempt.  Second, even if
       there were no change in net income, the ratios would decline if interest income and interest expense
       increase by the same amount due to an increase in the level of interest rates or, conversely, they would
       increase if interest income and interest expense decrease by the same amount due to a decrease in the
       level of interest rates.
