ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

     With a history dating back to 1889, Washington Mutual, Inc. is a financial
services company committed to serving consumers and small to mid-sized
businesses. Based on our consolidated assets at December 31, 2000, we were the
largest savings institution and the seventh largest banking company in the
United States.

     Our principal business offices are located at 1201 Third Avenue, Seattle,
Washington 98101 and our telephone number is (206) 461-2000. When we refer to
"we" or "Washington Mutual" or the "Company" in this Form 10-K, we mean
Washington Mutual, Inc., and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we refer to
WMI, we mean Washington Mutual, Inc. exclusively.

     Our business operations are conducted by our subsidiaries. Our principal
banking subsidiaries are Washington Mutual Bank, FA ("WMBFA"), Washington Mutual
Bank ("WMB") and Washington Mutual Bank fsb ("WMBfsb"). Our other principal
subsidiaries are Washington Mutual Finance Corporation ("Washington Mutual
Finance"), Long Beach Mortgage Company ("Long Beach Mortgage") and WM Financial
Services, Inc. ("WMFS").

     Our assets have grown over the last five years primarily through
acquisitions. In 1996, we acquired Keystone Holdings, Inc., the parent of
American Savings Bank, F.A. ("ASB"). This acquisition, referred to as the
"Keystone Transaction," gave us our first depository institution in California.
In 1997, we acquired Great Western Financial Corporation ("Great Western") and
in October 1998, we acquired H.F. Ahmanson & Co. ("Ahmanson"). In February 1998,
Ahmanson had acquired Coast Savings Financial, Inc. (the "Coast Acquisition").

     On January 31, 2001, we acquired the mortgage operations of The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc. The principal subsidiaries acquired in that
transaction were renamed Washington Mutual Home Loans, Inc. ("WMHLI") and
Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp. ("WMMSC").

     On February 9, 2001, we acquired Texas-based Bank United Corp., which was
merged into Washington Mutual, Inc. As a result, all of the subsidiaries of Bank
United Corp., including Bank United, a federally chartered savings bank, became
our subsidiaries. Bank United was subsequently merged into WMBFA.

     As a result of the acquisitions described above, our company has been
transformed into a national financial services company. Although we operate
principally in California, Washington, Oregon, Florida, Texas and Utah, we have
physical operations in 42 states.

     Effective January 1, 2001, we realigned our business segments. The
following discussion of our business portrays our business as it is now being
managed. Separately, we are in the process of enhancing our segment reporting
process methodologies and allocations and will be reporting segment results
under the new methodologies and as realigned beginning with the first quarter of
2001.

     These business segments are:

     - Banking and Financial Services Group

     - Home Loans and Insurance Services Group

     - Specialty Finance Group

     - Treasury Division

BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP

     Our Banking and Financial Services Group ("Banking & FS") offers a
comprehensive line of consumer and business financial products and services to
individuals and small and middle market businesses. We provide service to
approximately five million households through multiple delivery channels: over
1,100 finan-

                                        1
<PAGE>   4

cial centers (both free-standing and in-store), including 35 business banking
centers, and over 1,600 automated teller machines located in eight states. We
also offer our customers the convenience of 24-hour telephone and internet
banking and investment services.

     Our strategy is to expand our base of consumer and business relationships
by combining national convenience with local customer service and a broad-based
product line. In addition to traditional banking products, we offer investment
management, securities brokerage services and annuity products through our
subsidiaries and affiliates. In May 2000, we launched our own web complex, made
up of our banking site, wamu.com; Invest1to1.com and wmfinancial.com, which
provide on-line financial planning and stock trading; and wmgroupoffunds.com,
featuring WM Group of Funds information and interaction with investors and
financial advisors. In partnership with our Home Loans & Insurance Services
Group, mortgage loans and insurance products are made available through our
financial centers.

     Banking & FS offers various consumer and business deposit products, as well
as a variety of value-added, fee-based banking services. Deposit products
offered include checking accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit
accounts ("MMDAs") and time deposit accounts. Fee-based services include, but
are not limited to:

     - payment choices, including debit card, pay-by-phone, on-line banking,
       money orders, bank checks, and traveler's checks,

     - a membership program featuring free checks, a variety of product
       discounts, shopping and travel services, and credit card protection
       service, and

     - safety deposit box rentals.

     A primary focus of the Banking & FS Group in 2000 was the opening of
financial centers in Las Vegas with project Occasio(TM) (Latin for "favorable
opportunity"), which features a completely new retail approach to banking.
Occasio(TM) provides Banking & FS an additional vehicle for expanding into new
market areas where acquisition opportunities may be limited. Based on the
favorable customer acceptance and strong results in Las Vegas, we will expand
into Phoenix beginning in 2001 and will open a total of approximately 40
financial centers in Phoenix throughout 2001 and 2002. Occasio(TM) financial
centers welcome customers in an open, free-flowing retail environment where they
can either interact with roaming customer service representatives or become
engaged by high-tech, self-help, touch screens. Occasio(TM) focuses on the
customer and how the customer chooses to be served. Customers can also log onto
Washington Mutual's home page, which provides links to all of our internet
products and services.

     One of Banking & FS's primary business objectives is to expand consumer and
business lending activities, as they generally offer higher yields than prime
mortgage lending activities. The size of our consumer and commercial business
loan portfolio has grown in recent years, partly due to the introduction of the
consumer lending product line in California, Florida and Texas and the expansion
of WM Business Bank in California. The following consumer loan products are
available through our financial centers:

     - second mortgage loans, both for purposes unrelated to the property
       securing the loan and for a variety of purposes related to the property,
       including its renovation or remodeling,

     - manufactured housing loans,

     - purchase money loans for automobiles, marine and recreational vehicles,

     - student loans,

     - loans secured by deposit accounts, and

     - secured and unsecured loans made under our line of credit or term loan
       programs.

     We offer a full line of business loan products and banking services through
our Western Bank offices in the northwest and WM Business Bank offices in
California. We concentrate on developing and maintaining

                                        2
<PAGE>   5

strong client relationships with small and mid-sized companies. Our core
business customers are companies with $5 million to $100 million in sales. We
provide the following loan products to our business customers:

     - business lines of credit,

     - working capital loans,

     - equipment loans,

     - loans secured by real estate, and

     - Small Business Administration ("SBA") loans.

     We also offer an array of banking services to our business customers
including:

     - international trade finance,

     - deposit, cash, and treasury management services, and

     - merchant bankcard services.

     Commercial business loans are made on a secured or unsecured basis.
Collateral for secured commercial loans may be business assets, real estate,
personal assets, or some combination thereof. Our decision to make a consumer or
commercial loan is based on an evaluation of the borrower's financial capacity,
including such factors as income, other indebtedness and credit history; company
performance, in the case of commercial loans; and collateral.

     The merger with Bank United Corp. enhances our presence in the State of
Texas. Prior to the merger, our operations served more than 125,000 households
through 48 financial centers in and around Dallas and Houston. The merger with
Bank United Corp. adds over 300,000 households and approximately 160 financial
centers to our Texas presence and expands our market coverage into the Austin
and San Antonio markets. The merger with Bank United Corp. strengthens our
market position for business lending in Texas, as well as nationally through SBA
lending offices located in some of the nation's most attractive geographic
markets.

     Our investment services are offered through: (1) WMFS, a licensed
broker-dealer, (2) WM Fund Advisors, Inc. ("WM Advisors") providing investment
advisory and distribution services for the WM Group of Funds, and (3) the
Annuity Program. At December 31, 2000, WMFS was licensed in 49 states and Puerto
Rico and operated in the eight states where our financial centers are located.
Over 500 financial consultants and 800 licensed bank employees provide
investment services to retail customers.

     WM Advisors, our registered investment advisor subsidiary, had $8.21
billion of assets under management in 17 mutual funds, five asset management
portfolios, and one variable annuity at December 31, 2000. The WM Group of Funds
is managed both by WM Advisors and by three subadvisors. The WM Group of Funds
is distributed through our financial centers and is also distributed through a
network of over 400 broker-dealers and independent financial advisors. The
Annuity Program utilizes over 800 licensed bank employees who sell fixed
annuities to our customers.

HOME LOANS AND INSURANCE SERVICES GROUP

     The Home Loans and Insurance Services Group ("Home Loans Group")
originates, purchases and services the single-family residential ("SFR")
mortgage assets of WMBFA, WMB, WMBfsb, and Long Beach Mortgage. This group also
includes the activities of Washington Mutual Insurance Services, Inc., an
insurance agency that supports the mortgage lending process, as well as the
insurance needs of all consumers doing business with us.

     The Home Loans Group's mission is to be the premier catalyst for affordable
homeownership, using our proprietary approach to home lending encompassed in our
branding, the Power of Yes(TM). The goal of the Home Loans Group is to be the
nation's leading mortgage lender. We will measure our success by our origination
and servicing market share, our profitability, and brand awareness.

                                        3
<PAGE>   6

     During 2000, the Home Loans Group announced partnerships with two
electronic mortgage origination companies to develop a mortgage origination and
decision-making platform known as Optis(TM). This system will be available in
all of our distribution channels, which will allow consumers to conduct business
with us according to their preferences. In the third quarter of 2000, we
re-launched www.wamumortgage.com. The new site possesses a more robust
recommendation engine, numerous calculators, interactive customer service, and
provides 24-hour customer access to the status of their loan application.

     As of December 31, 2000, the Home Loans Group served about 1.2 million
households throughout the United States by providing a wide range of mortgage
financing products. Our principal banking subsidiaries offer first mortgage loan
products that provide permanent home financing as well as loans for the
construction of single-family homes. Permanent loans made available to consumers
include conventional fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage ("ARM") loans,
FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed fixed-rate mortgage loans, and both fixed- and
adjustable-rate Jumbo (loan amounts in excess of $275,000) loans. All loan
products are offered with a variety of maturities, amortization schedules and,
in the case of ARMs, rate repricing frequencies.

     The primary ARM products that we offer are indexed to the 12-month average
of the annual yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities
adjusted to a constant maturity of one-year ("MTA"). Under our current programs,
a borrower may choose among loans that have interim payment caps or interim
interest rate caps.

     Our loans with payment caps typically have monthly rate adjustments with
initial start rates fixed for one-, three-, six-, or twelve-months. We often
offer a "teaser" rate with our payment-capped ARMs, which means the initial
start rate of the loan is below market rates. These loans offer our borrowers
payment flexibility not offered in other loan products, which has made this our
most popular home-financing product. The loans feature four payment options each
month: a minimum payment based on the start rate; a payment that covers the full
interest due; a payment that ensures full amortization over the term of the
loan; and a payment that amortizes the loan over 15 years. These loans typically
have payments that we cannot change annually by more than a contractual
percentage, usually 7.5%. In addition, we offer loans with fixed initial start
rates for one-, three-, or five-years and annual rate adjustments thereafter.
The annual rate adjustments are usually limited to 2% and the payments are
always re-amortized to the remaining maturity of the loan. In addition, we offer
each of our loan products with a prepayment premium as well as at a different
rate without a prepayment premium.

     These mortgage products are made available to consumers through various
distribution channels, which include retail home loan centers, wholesale home
loan centers, financial centers and the internet. For 2000, based on total
originations, the Home Loans Group was the nation's largest ARM lender as well
as the nation's largest Jumbo lender. In addition, the Home Loans Group was the
nation's fifth largest residential lender and sixth largest residential loan
servicer.

     Two of our primary business objectives are to stabilize income and
diversify revenues. To achieve these objectives, we have implemented a
three-point strategy to generate: (1) spread income from loans held in
portfolio; (2) fee income through loan servicing, loan-related fees, and
insurance services income; and (3) gains from sales of loans and mortgage-backed
securities ("MBS").

     The acquisitions of Bank United Corp. and the mortgage operations of The
PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. further diversify our mortgage operations
geographically, enhance our position in the home loan business, and build our
loan servicing portfolio. These acquisitions make us the nation's second largest
residential mortgage originator and fourth largest servicer of residential
mortgages based on pro forma numbers for the year ended December 31, 2000. They
enhance our position by giving us a stronger capability to originate loans in
all 50 states, including originating FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed loans on a
national scale. With the acquisition of WMMSC, we also obtained an improved
capability to securitize loans and sell the resulting MBS in the secondary
market and to generate fee income through master servicing activities.

     Originations of prime SFR loans (excluding SFR construction loans)
increased during 2000, fueled particularly by originations of short-term ARMs,
which reprice primarily on a monthly basis according to the index (e.g., MTA,
11th District monthly weighted average cost of funds index ("COFI")) to which
the

                                        4
<PAGE>   7

ARMs are tied. The increase in short-term ARM originations was attributable to
the higher interest rate environment during the first half of 2000 and the
resulting customer preference for short-term ARMs over fixed-rate loans.

     We generally sell the fixed-rate SFR loans we originate. Most of the
fixed-rate conforming mortgage loans are sold to Fannie Mae. In addition, we
securitize loans that are also sold to Fannie Mae. We use our own underwriting
standards and origination system to originate loans.

     We occasionally securitize loans through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under
programs in which they have recourse against us as the servicer of the loans
("Recourse MBS"). These securitizations primarily involve ARMs. They generally
are less costly and sometimes require less documentation than securitizations
without recourse ("Non-Recourse MBS"). We can either sell Recourse MBS in the
secondary market or use them to collateralize borrowings and to meet regulatory
liquidity requirements. We have retained the majority of Recourse MBS in our
portfolio.

     The Home Loans Group has also been developing ways of selling ARM loans in
the secondary market to complement our existing strategy of selling fixed-rate
loans. Selling ARM loans in the secondary market will allow us to manage asset
growth more efficiently and should reduce the volatility of income related to
loans during changing interest rate environments. To achieve optimum pricing,
current ARM production that is not retained in the loan portfolio will either be
sold to investors shortly following origination or securitized and retained in
the available-for-sale securities portfolio for a period of time, and then sold
as Non-Recourse MBS. We expect to be able to increase the amount of noninterest
income relative to net interest income through gains on sales of loans and MBS
as well as loan servicing income.

     Through Long Beach Mortgage, we are engaged in the business of originating,
purchasing and selling specialty mortgage loans. Long Beach Mortgage originates
loans primarily through wholesale channels of production. Long Beach Mortgage's
nationwide network of independent mortgage loan brokers generates loans in all
50 states and the District of Columbia. In 2000, none of Long Beach Mortgage's
wholesale brokers was responsible for more than 1% of Long Beach Mortgage's
wholesale originations during the year. Long Beach Mortgage maintains a close
working relationship with brokers through its sales force of approximately 280
account executives located in 59 offices.

     Long Beach Mortgage has followed a strategy of selling or securitizing and
selling substantially all of its loan originations in the secondary market. Long
Beach Mortgage has historically sold its entire economic interest in the loan
except for the related servicing rights, which it has generally retained. In
2000, Long Beach Mortgage began securitizing and selling its production while
retaining rights to residual cash flows in the securities created.

     The Home Loans Group also purchases loan portfolios with risk
characteristics similar to those of loans originated by Long Beach Mortgage.
Because these portfolios, as well as those of Long Beach Mortgage, tend to have
higher credit risk, they generally provide higher yields than the prime mortgage
loans made by our banking subsidiaries and WMHLI. Our typical borrowers within
these portfolios would generally not qualify for a loan from our banking
subsidiaries due to their credit history, higher debt-to-income ratio or other
factors. While we screen these portfolios for unacceptable credit risk, these
loans, by their nature, bear more credit risk than is found in prime mortgage
loans or in agency MBS. Accordingly, we expect that loan charge offs on these
portfolios will be higher over time than on our other mortgage portfolios.

     In addition to SFR mortgage loans, the Home Loans Group also offers
construction financing on SFR properties. We make custom construction loans to
the intended occupant of a house to finance the house's construction. We
typically combine construction phase financing with permanent financing of the
completed home.

     All loans originated are subject to the same nondiscriminatory underwriting
standards. All loans are subject to underwriting review and approval by various
levels of our personnel, depending on the size and characteristics of the loan.
We require title insurance on all first liens on real property securing loans.
We also require our borrowers to maintain property and casualty insurance in an
amount at least equal to the total of

                                        5

our loan amount plus all prior liens on the property or the replacement cost of
the property, whichever is less. We perform re-underwriting and appraisal review
on some of the loans acquired from our correspondents.

     Washington Mutual Insurance Services, Inc. is an insurance agency that
supports the mortgage lending process by offering fire, homeowners, flood,
earthquake and other property and casualty insurance products to borrowers. In
addition, the agency offers mortgage life insurance, accidental death and
dismemberment, term, whole life, and other life insurance products to existing
mortgage and deposit customers. The Washington Mutual Insurance Services, Inc.
website, wamuins.com, was launched in October 2000, providing information,
quotes, and buying capabilities over the internet.

SPECIALTY FINANCE GROUP

     The Specialty Finance Group conducts operations through WMBFA, WMB, WMBfsb,
and Washington Mutual Finance. An array of commercial products are offered to
our customers through our group, all under the Washington Mutual brand name.
Additionally, consumer finance products are offered through Washington Mutual
Finance.

     The Specialty Finance Group provides industry specialty financing for the
following business sectors: syndicated finance, asset-based finance, and
franchise finance. In each of these areas, we have developed specialized
expertise that allows us to serve our markets efficiently while at the same time
ensuring high credit quality from a diverse group of customers.

     The merger with Bank United Corp. complements our plans to grow our
commercial business portfolio and extends our market presence into some of the
nation's most attractive geographic markets, including Texas. Like our existing
business, Bank United Corp. offers a full line of commercial products and
services to businesses across the nation. Lending programs added as a result of
the merger with Bank United Corp. include mortgage banker finance, and energy
and healthcare lending.

     The Specialty Finance Group provides real estate secured financing for
commercial and multi-family real estate lending and residential builder
construction. As a result of the merger with Bank United Corp., the Group also
provides non-real estate secured lending activities, as previously mentioned. In
addition, the Specialty Finance Group provides loan servicing for these lending
activities.

     Commercial and multi-family real estate loans are offered to property
owners and developers through 19 Washington Mutual commercial real estate
offices in Washington, Oregon, Utah, Colorado, and California. The payment
experience on loans secured by income-producing properties usually depends on
the successful operations of the real estate projects that secure the loans and,
thus, may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or in the
economy, particularly the interest rate environment. Commercial real estate
values tend to be cyclical and, while commercial real estate values trended
upward in many parts of the country in 2000, we closely monitor the commercial
real estate environment to determine the appropriate level of our activity in
this area. In commercial real estate lending, we consider the project's
location, marketability, and overall attractiveness. Current underwriting
guidelines for commercial real estate loans require an economic analysis of each
property with regard to the annual revenue and expenses, debt service coverage,
and fair value to determine the maximum loan amount. Before we make a commercial
real estate loan, various levels of approvals must be obtained depending on the
size and characteristics of the loan.

     Residential builder construction provides loans to borrowers who are in the
business of acquiring land and building homes for resale. Each builder loan is
made on a property-by-property basis and generally matures one to three years
from origination. Proper consideration is given to the higher risk inherent in
these transactions as each loan is underwritten. During 2000, substantially all
of our SFR builder construction loans were made in Washington, Oregon, Utah,
Florida, and California. The addition of Bank United Corp.'s residential builder
construction business qualifies us as one of the largest builder construction
lenders in the nation and diversifies our geographic market presence.

     Mortgage banker finance provides small- and medium-sized mortgage and
consumer finance companies with credit facilities, including secured lines of
credit, securities purchased under agreements to resell and

                                        6
<PAGE>   9

working capital credit lines. Mortgage banker finance also offers cash
management, document custody, and deposit services to its customers.

     Washington Mutual Finance currently operates 533 branches in 25 states,
primarily in the southeastern United States, Texas and California. Washington
Mutual Finance originates and services consumer installment loans and real
estate secured loans. These loans, which are generally held in the loan
portfolio, are primarily for personal, family or household purposes. These loans
typically have original terms ranging from 12 to 360 months. In 2000,
originations had an average original term of 74 months. Of the originations (in
dollars) in 2000, 70% were unsecured or secured by luxury goods, automobiles or
other personal property, and 30% were secured by real estate. Additionally,
Washington Mutual Finance acquires installment contracts from local retail
establishments, usually without recourse to the originating merchant. These
contracts are typically written with original terms of three to 60 months,
averaging 28 months in 2000.

     The loans made by Washington Mutual Finance generally have a higher yield
than the prime mortgage loans made by our banking subsidiaries, because these
loans tend to have higher credit risk. Our typical consumer finance borrower
would generally not qualify for a loan from our banking subsidiaries due to
their credit history, high debt-to-income ratio or other factors.

TREASURY DIVISION

     The primary responsibilities of our treasury division are:

     - interest rate risk management,

     - liquidity management,

     - investing activities,

     - borrowing activities, and

     - capital management.

  Interest Rate Risk Management

     We actively manage the amounts and maturities of our assets and liabilities
to mitigate repricing and prepayment risks. We sell fixed-rate loans, since they
are difficult to match in duration to liabilities because of prepayment risk and
longer maturities. To further mitigate repricing risk, prepayment risk, and to a
lesser extent cap risk, we use derivative instruments, such as interest rate
exchange agreements and interest rate cap agreements. See "Management of
Interest Rate Risk and Derivative Activities." We do not attempt to hedge lag or
basis risk because the impacts of these risks are usually short-lived and the
cost of hedging is high.

     To monitor the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes, we conduct
financial modeling of the balance sheet and earnings under a variety of interest
rate scenarios. This modeling does require significant assumptions about loan
prepayment rates, loan origination volumes and liability funding sources. While
these assumptions may ultimately differ from actual results, these simulations
are helpful for measuring interest rate sensitivity. We monitor interest rate
sensitivity and attempt to reduce the risk of a significant decrease in net
interest income caused by a change in interest rates. We also monitor the impact
of interest rate changes on our net portfolio value.

  Liquidity Management

     Our liquidity policy is to maintain sufficient liquidity above daily
funding needs to protect against unforeseen liquidity demands. We manage
liquidity primarily through the securitization of mortgage loans and through
various sources of borrowings, including securities sold under agreements to
repurchase ("repurchase agreements"), Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances,
and other secured and unsecured sources of funds.

                                        7
<PAGE>   10

  Investing Activities

     We manage the Company's purchased investment securities, which are
primarily comprised of agency MBS and investment grade private MBS. During 2000,
our purchases of MBS declined, since the MBS had acceptable, but lower returns
than loans originated by us and held in our portfolio or securitized and
retained.

  Borrowing Activities

     To keep pace with asset growth in recent years, we have increasingly relied
on wholesale borrowings to fund asset growth. Borrowings include repurchase
agreements, the purchase of federal funds, the issuance of capital notes and
other types of debt securities, the issuance of commercial paper, and funds
obtained as advances from the FHLBs of Seattle and San Francisco. We also have
access to the Federal Reserve Bank's discount window.

     We actively engage in repurchase agreements with authorized broker-dealers
and major customers, selling U.S. Government debt securities and MBS under
agreements to repurchase them at a future date.

     WMB and WMBfsb are members of the FHLB of Seattle, and WMBFA is a member of
the FHLB of San Francisco. As members, each company maintains a credit line that
is a percentage of its total regulatory assets, subject to collateralization
requirements. Each institution obtaining FHLB advances is required to enter into
a written agreement with the lending FHLB under which the borrowing institution
is primarily and unconditionally obligated to repay such advances and all other
amounts owed to the lending FHLB. All advances must be fully secured by eligible
collateral. Eligible collateral includes all stock owned of the FHLBs, deposits
with the FHLBs, and certain mortgages or deeds of trust and securities of the
U.S. Government and its agencies.

     Our depository institutions accept deposits, primarily time deposit
accounts, from political subdivisions and public agencies. We consider these
deposits to be a borrowing source rather than a customer relationship and,
hence, they are managed by the treasury division.

     Other funding activities include the issuance of commercial paper by WMI
and Washington Mutual Finance. We have commercial paper facilities backed by
combined credit facilities from a syndicate of banks. We also issue senior and
subordinated debt at WMI and WMBFA, and senior notes at Washington Mutual
Finance.

  Capital Management

     In order to deploy accumulated capital, we repurchased our common stock
during the first half of 2000. From April 20, 1999, the inception of the
repurchase program, through June 30, 2000, we repurchased a total of 66.3
million shares as part of our previously announced purchase programs. We did not
repurchase any shares during the last half of 2000. During this time, capital
was accumulated to facilitate balance sheet growth and accommodate the
acquisitions of Bank United Corp. and the mortgage operations of The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc. Our capital management strategy also focuses on
the risk-based capital and leverage ratios of our principal banking
subsidiaries.

EMPLOYEES

     Our number of full-time equivalent employees ("FTE") at December 31, 2000
was 28,798, a slight increase from 28,509 at December 31, 1999. During the
previous year, the number of FTE also increased slightly from 27,957 at December
31, 1998, primarily as a result of approximately 1,000 employees added in the
acquisition of Long Beach Mortgage. We believe that we have been successful in
attracting quality employees and that our employee relations are good.

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT

     We operate in a highly competitive environment. The activities of our three
major lines of business (Banking and Financial Services, Home Loans and
Insurance Services, and Specialty Finance) are subject to

                                        8
<PAGE>   11

significant competition in attracting and retaining deposits and making loans as
well as in providing other financial services in all of our market areas.
Competition focuses on customer services, interest rates on loans and deposits,
lending limits and customer convenience, such as product lines offered and the
accessibility of services.

     Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from savings
institutions, credit unions and commercial banks doing business in our primary
market areas of California, Washington, Oregon, Florida, Texas and Utah. Enacted
in 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley ("GLB") Act does not increase our authority to
affiliate, but it does benefit our competitors, as discussed below. See
"Business -- Regulation and Supervision." As with all banking organizations, we
have also experienced competition from nonbanking sources, including mutual
funds, corporate and governmental debt securities and other investment
alternatives offered within and outside of our primary market areas.

     Our most direct competition for loans has traditionally come from other
savings institutions, national mortgage companies, insurance companies,
commercial banks and government-sponsored enterprises ("GSEs"). In addition to
the provisions of the GLB Act, technological advances and heightened e-commerce
activities have also increased accessibility to services without physical
presence, which has intensified competition among banking as well as nonbanking
companies in offering financial products and services. Although our competitors'
activities may make it a bigger challenge for us to achieve our financial goals,
we are continuously reassessing our overall competitive edge to attract more
customers for our products and services.

     With the changes in technology and increased competition from banking as
well as from nonbanking entities, the traditional environment in which we have
operated in the past has been transformed into a fiercely dynamic and
competitive environment. Although we are faced with increased competitive
pressures, we remain adaptable to these changes by continuously reviewing and
redefining the ways in which we do our business and, as a result, we remain a
strong market force in our core areas.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

     From time to time, we have made and will make forward-looking statements.
Our Form 10-K and other documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission have forward-looking statements. In addition, our senior management
may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, the media,
and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they
do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words,
such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks,"
"estimates," or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs, such
as "will," "would," "should," "could," or "may."

     Forward-looking statements provide our expectations or predictions of
future conditions, events or results. They are not guarantees of future
performance. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to risks
and uncertainties. These statements speak only as of the date they are made. We
do not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of
circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statements
were made. There are a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control,
that could cause actual conditions, events or results to differ significantly
from those described in the forward-looking statements.

     Some of these factors are described below.

  Business and Economic Conditions

     Our business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic
conditions. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates,
inflation, monetary supply, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital
markets, the strength of the U.S. economy, and the local economies in which we
conduct business. If any of these conditions worsen, our business and earnings
could be adversely affected. For example, if interest rates continue to decline,
this could increase loan prepayments, which could lead to a decline in the value
of our mortgage servicing rights. An economic downturn or rising interest rate

                                        9
<PAGE>   12

environment could decrease the demand for loans and increase the number of
customers who become delinquent or default on their loans. An increase in
delinquencies or defaults could result in a higher level of charge offs and
provision for loan and lease losses, which could adversely affect our earnings.
Higher interest rates would also increase our cost of interest-bearing
liabilities, which could outpace the increase in the yield on interest-earning
assets and lead to a reduction in the net interest margin.

  Diversification of Assets

     We have reduced the percentage of SFR loans and MBS in our portfolio and
increased the percentage of consumer loans, commercial business loans and
specialty mortgage finance loans. Although these loans generally provide a
higher yield than our SFR loans and MBS, they also carry more credit risk. To
the extent that we need to increase our provision for loan and lease losses as a
result of these loans, our earnings could be adversely affected. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations ("MD&A") -- Provision and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses" in
this Form 10-K for more specific discussion.

  Concentration of Operations in California

     At December 31, 2000, 52% of our loan portfolio and 71% of our deposits
were concentrated in California. As a result, our results of operations and
financial condition are particularly subject to the conditions in the
single-family and multi-family residential markets in California. If economic
conditions generally, or in California in particular, worsen or if the market
for residential real estate declines, we may experience greater delinquencies,
which may result in decreased net income and decreased collateral values on our
existing portfolio. We also may not be able to originate the volume or type of
loans or achieve the level of deposits that we currently anticipate.

     The forward-looking statements contained within MD&A assume that the
California economy and real estate market will remain healthy. Worsening of
economic conditions or a significant decline in real estate values in California
could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.

  Competition

     We face significant competition both in attracting and retaining deposits
and in making loans in all of our markets. As with all banking organizations, we
have also experienced competition from nonbanking sources, including mutual
funds and securities brokerage companies. We expect increased competition in the
financial services industry as a result of recent legislation that removes many
of the restrictions on affiliations among banks, insurance companies, and
securities firms. Our most direct competition for loans comes from other savings
institutions, national mortgage companies, insurance companies, commercial
banks, and government-sponsored enterprises ("GSEs"), such as Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac. Competition from such sources could increase in the future and
could adversely affect our ability to achieve our financial goals. In addition,
competitive factors, such as the lower cost structure of less-regulated
originators and the influence of the GSEs in establishing rates, heavily
influence our lending activities.

  Fiscal and Monetary Policies

     Our business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and
monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. We are
particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board, which
regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. The Federal
Reserve Board's policies directly and indirectly influence the yield on our
interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities.
Changes in those policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict.

  Mergers and Acquisitions

     We expand our business, in part, by acquiring other financial institutions
or a portion of their business. We continue to explore opportunities to acquire
other financial institutions that will complement and enhance our key
strategies. A number of factors related to past and future acquisitions could
adversely affect our

                                        10
<PAGE>   13

business and earnings. In addition, our acquisitions are often subject to
regulatory approval. The failure to receive required regulatory approvals within
the time frame or on the conditions expected by management could also adversely
affect our business and earnings.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

     Most of our growth since 1988 has occurred as a result of business
combinations. The following table summarizes our business combinations since
1988:

TAXATION

  General

     For federal income tax purposes, we report income and expenses using the
accrual method of accounting on a calendar year basis. We are subject to federal
income tax under existing provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), in generally the same manner as other corporations.

                                        11
<PAGE>   14

  Tax Bad Debt Reserve Recapture

     The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (the "Job Protection Act")
requires that qualified thrift institutions, such as WMBFA, WMB and WMBfsb,
generally recapture for federal income tax purposes that portion of the balance
of their tax bad debt reserves that exceeds the December 31, 1987 balance, with
certain adjustments. Such recaptured amounts generally are to be taken into
ordinary income ratably over a six-year period beginning in 1997. Accordingly,
we have paid or will have to pay approximately an additional $4 million (based
upon current federal income tax rates) each year of the six-year period in
federal income taxes due to the Job Protection Act.

  State Income Taxation

     The states of California, Oregon, Florida, Texas, Utah and Idaho, as well
as many other states in which we do business, impose corporate income taxes on
companies doing business in those states.

     The state of Washington does not currently have a corporate income tax.
Washington imposes on businesses a business and occupation tax based on a
percentage of gross receipts. Currently, the tax does not apply to interest
received on loans secured by first mortgages or deeds of trust on residential
properties. However, it is possible that legislation might be introduced in the
future that would repeal or limit this exemption.

  Assistance Agreement

     As a result of the acquisition of ASB in 1996, we are party to an agreement
(the "Assistance Agreement") with a predecessor of the Federal Savings & Loan
Insurance Corporation Resolution Fund (the "FRF"). The Assistance Agreement
provides, in part, for the payment to the FRF over time of 75% of most of the
federal tax savings and 19.5% of most of the California tax savings (in each
case computed in accordance with specific provisions contained in the Assistance
Agreement) attributable to the utilization of certain tax loss carryforwards of
New West Federal Savings and Loan Association. The provision for such payments
is reflected in the financial statements as "Income Taxes." See "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements -- Note 12: Income Taxes."

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

     Our business and properties are subject to federal and state laws and
regulations governing environmental matters, including the regulation of
hazardous substances and wastes. For example, under the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and similar
state laws, owners and operators of contaminated properties may be liable for
the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances without regard to whether such
persons actually caused the contamination. Such laws may affect us both as an
owner of properties used in or held for our business, and as a secured lender of
property that is found to contain hazardous substances or wastes.

     Further, although CERCLA exempts holders of security interests, the
exemption may not be available if a secured party engages in the management of
its borrower or the collateral property in a manner deemed beyond the protection
of the secured party's interest. Recent federal and state legislation, as well
as guidance issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and a
number of court decisions, have provided assurance to lenders regarding the
activities they may undertake and remain within CERCLA's secured party
exemption. However, these assurances are not absolute and generally will not
protect a lender or fiduciary that participates or otherwise involves itself in
the management of its borrower, particularly in foreclosure proceedings. As a
result, CERCLA and similar state statutes may influence our decision whether to
foreclose on property that is found to be contaminated. Our general policy is to
obtain an environmental assessment prior to foreclosure of commercial property.
The existence of hazardous substances or wastes on such property may cause us to
elect not to foreclose on the property, thereby limiting, and in some instances
precluding, our realization on such loans.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

     References in this section to applicable statutes and regulations are brief
summaries only. You should consult the statutes and regulations for a full
understanding of the details of their operation.

  General

     As a savings and loan holding company, WMI is subject to regulation by the
Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS"). WMBFA and WMBfsb are federal savings
associations and are subject to extensive regulation and examination by the OTS,
which is their primary federal regulator. Their deposit accounts are insured by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), through the Savings
Association Insurance Fund (the "SAIF") and, to a lesser extent, in the case of
WMBFA, the Bank Insurance Fund (the "BIF"). The FDIC also has some authority to
regulate WMBFA and WMBfsb. WMB is subject to regulation and supervision by the
Director of Financial Institutions of the State of Washington ("State
Director"). The FDIC insures the deposit accounts of WMB through both the BIF
and the SAIF. The FDIC examines and regulates WMB and other state-chartered
banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System ("FDIC-regulated
banks"). Federal and state laws and regulations govern, among other things,
investment powers, deposit activities, borrowings, maintenance of guaranty funds
and retained earnings.

     State and federal laws govern our consumer finance subsidiaries. Federal
laws apply to various aspects of their lending practices. State laws establish
applicable licensing requirements, provide for periodic examinations and
establish maximum finance charges on credit extensions.

     On November 12, 1999, the GLB Act was signed into law. The GLB Act
significantly reforms various aspects of the financial services business and
includes provisions which:

     - establish a new framework under which bank holding companies and banks
       (subject to numerous restrictions) can own securities firms, insurance
       companies and other financial companies;

     - generally subject banks to the same securities regulation as other
       providers of securities products;

     - prohibit new unitary savings and loan holding companies from engaging in
       nonfinancial activities or affiliating with nonfinancial entities;

     - provide consumers with new protections regarding the transfer and use of
       their nonpublic personal information by financial institutions; and

     - change the FHLB system in numerous ways, which are described in more
       detail below.

     The provisions permitting full affiliations between bank holding companies
or banks and other financial companies do not increase our authority to
affiliate. As a unitary savings and loan holding company, we were generally
permitted to have such affiliations prior to the enactment of the GLB Act. It is
expected, however, that these provisions will benefit our competitors.

     The provisions subjecting banks to securities regulation are not expected
to significantly affect us since primarily all of our securities business is
conducted through securities subsidiaries that are already subject to such
regulation. Some new provisions restricting or regulating ownership of insurance
companies by banks apply also to savings institutions, and may hinder WMBFA,
WMBfsb or WMB from acquiring certain insurance companies.

                                        13
<PAGE>   16

     The prohibition on the ability of new unitary savings and loan holding
companies to engage in nonfinancial activities or affiliating with nonfinancial
entities generally applies only to savings and loan holding companies that were
not, or had not submitted an application to become, savings and loan holding
companies as of May 4, 1999. Since we were treated as a unitary savings and loan
holding company prior to that date, the GLB Act will not prohibit us from
engaging in nonfinancial activities or acquiring nonfinancial subsidiaries.
However, the GLB Act generally restricts any nonfinancial entity from acquiring
us unless such nonfinancial entity was, or had submitted an application to
become, a savings and loan holding company as of May 4, 1999.

     Management does not believe that complying with the new consumer privacy
provision will have a significant impact on our business.

     Changes to the FHLB system in the GLB Act included a change in the manner
of calculating the Resolution Funding Corporation ("REFCORP") obligations
payable by the FHLBs; a broadening of purposes for which FHLB advances may be
used; and removal of the requirement that federal savings associations be FHLB
members. Previously, the aggregate amount of the annual REFCORP obligation paid
by all FHLBs was $300 million. The GLB Act imposes an annual obligation equal to
20% of the net earnings of the FHLBs. This change will result in a greater
obligation in years when FHLBs have high income levels, thereby reducing the
return on members' investments. With the broadening in the purpose for which
FHLB advances can be used, our borrowing costs may rise as demand for advances
increases.

  Holding Company Regulation

     WMI is a multiple savings and loan holding company, as defined by federal
law, because it owns three savings associations: WMB, WMBFA and WMBfsb. WMB is a
state-chartered savings bank that has elected to be treated as a savings
association for purposes of the federal savings and loan holding company law.
WMI is regulated as a unitary savings and loan holding company because WMBFA and
WMBfsb are deemed to have been acquired in supervisory transactions. Therefore,
certain restrictions under federal law on the activities and investments of
multiple savings and loan holding companies do not apply to WMI. These
restrictions will apply to WMI if WMB, WMBFA or WMBfsb fails to be a qualified
thrift lender ("QTL"). By this we mean generally that:

     - at least 65% of a specified asset base must consist of: loans to small
       businesses, credit card loans, educational loans, or certain assets
       related to domestic residential real estate, including residential
       mortgage loans and mortgage securities; or

     - at least 60% of total assets must consist of cash, United States
       government or government agency debt or equity securities, fixed assets,
       or loans secured by: deposits, real property used for residential,
       educational, church, welfare or health purposes, or real property in
       certain urban renewal areas.

     WMB, WMBFA and WMBfsb are currently in compliance with QTL standards.
Failure to remain a QTL would restrict the ability of WMBFA, WMBfsb or WMB to
obtain advances from the FHLB. Failure to remain a QTL also would restrict the
ability of WMBFA or WMBfsb to establish new branches and pay dividends.

     Acquisitions by Savings and Loan Holding Companies. Neither WMI nor any
other person may acquire control of a savings institution or a savings and loan
holding company without the prior approval of the OTS, or, if the acquirer is an
individual, the OTS' lack of disapproval. In either case, the public must have
an opportunity to comment on the proposed acquisition, and the OTS must complete
an application review. Without prior approval from the OTS, WMI may not acquire
more than 5% of the voting stock of any savings institution that is not one of
its subsidiaries.

     Annual Reporting; Examinations. Under the Home Owners' Loan Act ("HOLA")
and OTS regulations WMI, as a savings and loan holding company, must file
periodic reports with the OTS. In addition, WMI must comply with OTS record
keeping requirements.

                                        14
<PAGE>   17

     WMI is subject to holding company examination by the OTS. The OTS may take
enforcement action if the activities of a savings and loan holding company
constitute a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a
subsidiary savings association.

     Commonly Controlled Depository Institutions; Affiliate
Transactions. Depository institutions are "commonly controlled" if they are
controlled by the same holding company or if one depository institution controls
another depository institution. WMI controls WMB, WMBFA and WMBfsb. The FDIC has
authority to require FDIC-insured banks and savings associations to reimburse
the FDIC for losses it incurs in connection either with the default of a
"commonly controlled" depository institution or with the FDIC's provision of
assistance to such an institution.

     WMB, WMBFA and WMBfsb, as holding company subsidiaries that are depository
institutions, are subject to both qualitative and quantitative limitations on
the transactions they conduct with WMI and its other subsidiaries.

     Capital Adequacy. WMI is not currently subject to any regulatory capital
requirements, but each of its subsidiary depository institutions is subject to
various capital requirements. See "Regulation and Supervision-Capital
Requirements." The OTS has proposed a regulation which would require savings and
loan holding companies to give prior notice to the OTS of certain transactions
which could affect capital and which would also set forth the circumstances
under which the OTS would, on a case-by-case basis, review a holding company's
capital adequacy and, when necessary, require additional capital.

  Subsidiary Savings Institution Regulation

     As federally-chartered savings associations, WMBFA and WMBfsb are subject
to regulation and supervision by the OTS. As a state-chartered savings bank, WMB
is subject to regulation and supervision by the State Director and the FDIC.

     Federal Regulation and Supervision of WMBFA and WMBfsb. Federal statutes
empower federal savings institutions, such as WMBFA and WMBfsb, to conduct,
subject to various conditions and limitations, business activities that include:

     - accepting deposits and paying interest on them;

     - making loans on residential and other real estate;

     - making a limited amount of consumer loans;

     - making a limited amount of commercial loans;

     - investing in corporate obligations, government debt securities, and other
       securities;

     - offering various trust and banking services to their customers; and

     - owning subsidiaries that invest in real estate and carry on certain other
       activities.

     OTS regulations further delineate such institutions' investment and lending
powers. Federal savings institutions generally may not invest in
noninvestment-grade debt securities, nor may they generally make equity
investments, other than investments in service corporations.

     State Regulation and Supervision. Washington State statutes empower savings
banks, such as WMB, to conduct, subject to various conditions and limitations,
business activities that include:

     - accepting deposits and paying interest on them;

     - making loans on or investing in residential and other real estate;

     - making consumer loans;

     - making commercial loans;

     - investing in corporate obligations, government debt securities, and other
       securities;

                                        15
<PAGE>   18

     - offering various trust and banking services to their customers; and

     - owning subsidiaries that engage in a wide variety of activities.

     Under state law, savings banks in Washington also generally have all of the
powers that federal mutual savings banks have under federal laws and
regulations.

     Federal Prohibitions on Exercise of State Bank Powers. Federal law
prohibits banks, such as WMB, and their subsidiaries from exercising certain
powers that were granted by state law to make investments or carry on activities
as principal (i.e., for their own account) unless either (i) national banks have
power under federal law to make such investments or carry on such activities, or
(ii) the bank and such investments or activities meet certain requirements
established by federal law and the FDIC.

     Federal Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates. All banks and savings
institutions are subject to affiliate and insider transaction rules applicable
to member banks of the Federal Reserve System set forth in Sections 23A, 23B,
22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, as well as such additional
limitations as the institution's primary federal regulator may adopt. These
provisions prohibit or limit a savings institution from extending credit to, or
entering into certain transactions with, affiliates, principal stockholders,
directors and executive officers of the savings institution and its affiliates.
For these purposes, the term "affiliate" generally includes a holding company
such as WMI and any company under common control with the savings institution.
In addition, the federal law governing unitary savings and loan holding
companies flatly prohibits WMB, WMBFA or WMBfsb from making any loan to any
affiliate whose activity is not permitted for a subsidiary of a bank holding
company. This law also prohibits WMB, WMBFA or WMBfsb from making any equity
investment in any affiliate that is not its subsidiary. We currently are in
material compliance with all these provisions.

     Restrictions on Subsidiary Savings Institution Capital Distributions. WMI's
principal sources of funds are cash dividends paid to it by its banking and
other subsidiaries, investment income and borrowings. Federal and state law
limits the ability of a depository institution, such as WMB, WMBFA or WMBfsb, to
pay dividends or make other capital distributions.

     Washington state law prohibits WMB from declaring or paying a dividend
greater than its retained earnings if doing so would cause its net worth to be
reduced below (i) the amount required for the protection of preconversion
depositors or (ii) the net worth requirements, if any, imposed by the State
Director.

     OTS regulations limit the ability of savings associations such as WMBFA and
WMBfsb to pay dividends and make other capital distributions. Associations (such
as WMBFA and WMBfsb) that are subsidiaries of a savings and loan holding company
must file a notice with the OTS at least 30 days before the proposed declaration
of a dividend or approval of the proposed capital distribution by its board of
directors. In addition, a savings association must obtain prior approval from
the OTS if it fails to meet certain regulatory conditions, if, after giving
effect to the proposed distribution, the association's capital distributions in
a calendar year would exceed its year-to-date net income plus retained net
income for the preceding two years or the association would not be at least
adequately capitalized or if the distribution would violate a statute,
regulation, regulatory agreement or a regulatory condition to which the
association is subject.

  FDIC Insurance

     The FDIC insures the deposits of each of our banking subsidiaries to the
applicable maximum in each institution. The FDIC administers two separate
deposit insurance funds, the BIF and the SAIF. The BIF is a deposit insurance
fund for commercial banks and some state-chartered savings banks. The SAIF is a
deposit insurance fund for most savings associations. WMB is a member of the
BIF, but a portion of its deposits is insured through the SAIF. WMBFA and WMBfsb
are members of the SAIF, but a portion of WMBFA's deposits is insured through
the BIF. WMB and WMBFA are subject to payment of assessments ratably to both
funds.

     The FDIC has established a risk-based system for setting deposit insurance
assessments. Under the risk-based assessment system, an institution's insurance
assessments vary according to the level of capital the

                                        16
<PAGE>   19

institution holds and the degree to which it is the subject of supervisory
concern. In addition, regardless of the potential risk to the insurance fund,
federal law requires the FDIC to establish assessment rates that will maintain
each insurance fund's ratio of reserves to insured deposits at $1.25 per $100.
Both funds currently meet this reserve ratio. During 2000, the assessment rate
for both SAIF and BIF deposits ranged from zero to 0.27% of covered deposits.
WMB and WMBFA qualified for the lowest rate on their BIF deposits in 2000, and
WMB, WMBFA and WMBfsb qualified for the lowest rate on their SAIF deposits in
2000. Accordingly, none of these institutions paid any deposit insurance
assessments in 2000.

     In addition to deposit insurance assessments, the FDIC is authorized to
collect assessments against insured deposits to be paid to the Financing
Corporation ("FICO") to service FICO debt incurred in the 1980s. The FICO
assessment rate is adjusted quarterly.

     Before 2000, the FICO assessment rate for SAIF-insured deposits was five
times higher than the rate for BIF-insured deposits. The average annual
assessment rate in 1999 was 5.925 cents per $100 of SAIF-insured deposits and
1.185 cents per $100 of BIF-insured deposits. Beginning in 2000, SAIF- and
BIF-insured deposits were assessed at the same rate by FICO. For the year 2000,
the average annual rate was 2.07 cents per $100 of insured deposits. Because we
have substantially more SAIF-insured deposits than BIF-insured deposits, this
change resulted in an overall reduction of the amount of our FICO assessments.

  Capital Requirements

     Each of our subsidiary depository institutions is subject to various
capital requirements. WMB is subject to FDIC capital requirements, while WMBFA
and WMBfsb are subject to OTS capital requirements.

     WMB. FDIC regulations recognize two types or tiers of capital: core ("Tier
1") capital and supplementary ("Tier 2") capital. Tier 1 capital generally
includes common stockholders' equity and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock
less most intangible assets. Tier 2 capital, which is limited to 100% of Tier 1
capital, includes such items as qualifying general loan loss reserves,
cumulative perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible debt, term
subordinated debt and limited life preferred stock; however, the amount of term
subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock that may be included in
Tier 2 capital is limited to 50% of Tier 1 capital.

     The FDIC uses a combination of risk-based guidelines and leverage ratios to
evaluate capital adequacy. Under the risk-based capital guidelines, different
categories of assets are assigned different risk weights, based generally on the
perceived credit risk of the asset. For example, U.S. Treasury Bills and GNMA
securities are placed in the 0% risk category, FNMA and FHLMC MBS are placed in
the 20% risk category, loans secured by SFR properties and certain private issue
MBS are generally placed in the 50% risk category, and commercial real estate
and consumer loans are generally placed in the 100% risk category. These risk
weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a
risk-weighted asset base. Certain off-balance sheet items are added to the
risk-weighted asset base by converting them to a balance sheet equivalent and
assigning them the appropriate risk weight in one of four categories.

     Under FDIC guidelines, the ratio of total capital (Tier 1 capital plus Tier
2 capital) to risk-weighted assets must be at least 8.00%, and the ratio of Tier
1 capital to risk-weighted assets must be at least 4.00%.

     In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the FDIC uses a leverage
ratio to evaluate a bank's capital adequacy. Most banks are required to maintain
a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets of 4.00%. The FDIC
retains the right to require a particular institution to maintain a higher
capital level based on the institution's particular risk profile.

     The FDIC may consider other factors that may affect a bank's financial
condition. These factors may include interest rate risk exposure, liquidity,
funding and market risks, the quality and level of earnings, concentration of
credit risk, risks arising from nontraditional activities, loan and investment
quality, the effectiveness of loan and investment policies, and management's
ability to monitor and control financial operating risks.

    excellent asset quality, high liquidity, good earnings, effective management
    and monitoring of market risk and, in general, are considered top-rate,
    strong banking organizations.

     WMBFA and WMBfsb. The OTS requires savings associations, such as WMBFA and
WMBfsb, to meet each of three separate capital adequacy standards:

     - a core capital leverage requirement,

     - a tangible capital requirement, and

     - a risk-based capital requirement.

     For a limited time, core capital may include certain amounts of qualifying
supervisory goodwill.

     OTS regulations incorporate a risk-based capital requirement that is
designed to be no less stringent than the capital standard applicable to
national banks. It is modeled in many respects on, but not identical to, the
risk-based capital requirements adopted by the FDIC. Associations whose exposure
to interest-rate risk is deemed to be above normal will be required to deduct a
portion of such exposure in calculating their risk-based capital. The OTS may
establish, on a case-by-case basis, individual minimum capital requirements for
a savings association that vary from the requirements that otherwise would apply
under the OTS capital regulations. The OTS has not established such individual
minimum capital requirements for WMBFA or WMBfsb.

    strong banking organizations.

  FDICIA Requirements

     FDICIA created a statutory framework that increased the importance of
meeting applicable capital requirements. FDICIA established five capital
categories:

     - well-capitalized,

     - adequately capitalized,

     - undercapitalized,

     - significantly undercapitalized, and

     - critically undercapitalized.

                                        18
<PAGE>   21

     An institution's category depends upon where its capital levels are in
relation to relevant capital measures, which include a risk-based capital
measure, a leverage ratio capital measure, and certain other factors. The
federal banking agencies (including the FDIC and the OTS) have adopted
regulations that implement this statutory framework. Under these regulations, an
institution is treated as well-capitalized if its ratio of total capital to
risk-weighted assets is 10.00% or more, its ratio of core capital to
risk-weighted assets is 6.00% or more, its leverage ratio is 5.00% or more, and
it is not subject to any federal supervisory order or directive to meet a
specific capital level. In order to be adequately capitalized, an institution
must have a total risk-based capital ratio of not less than 8.00%, a Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio of not less than 4.00%, and a leverage ratio of not
less than 4.00%. Any institution that is neither well capitalized nor adequately
capitalized will be considered undercapitalized.

     Federal law requires that the federal banking agencies' risk-based capital
guidelines take into account various factors including interest rate risk,
concentration of credit risk, risks associated with nontraditional activities,
and the actual performance and expected risk of loss of multi-family mortgages.
In 1994, the federal banking agencies jointly revised their capital standards to
specify that concentration of credit and nontraditional activities are among the
factors that the agencies will consider in evaluating capital adequacy. In that
year, the OTS and FDIC amended their risk-based capital standards with respect
to the risk weighting of loans made to finance the purchase or construction of
multi-family residences. The OTS adopted final regulations adding an interest
rate risk component to the risk-based capital requirements for savings
associations (such as WMBFA and WMBfsb), although implementation of the
regulation has been delayed. Management believes that the effect of including
such an interest rate risk component in the calculation of risk-adjusted capital
will not cause WMBFA or WMBfsb to cease to be well capitalized. In June 1996,
the FDIC and certain other federal banking agencies (not including the OTS)
issued a joint policy statement providing guidance on prudent interest rate risk
management principles. The agencies stated that they would evaluate the banks'
interest rate risk on a case-by-case basis, and would not adopt a standardized
measure or establish an explicit minimum capital charge for interest rate risk.

  Other FDIC and OTS Regulations and Examination Authority

     The FDIC has adopted regulations to protect the deposit insurance funds and
depositors, including regulations governing the deposit insurance of various
forms of accounts. The FDIC also has adopted numerous regulations to protect the
safety and soundness of FDIC-regulated banks. These regulations cover a wide
range of subjects including financial reporting, change in bank control,
affiliations with securities firms and capital requirements. In certain
instances, these regulations restrict the exercise of powers granted by state
law.

     An FDIC regulation and a joint FDIC/OTS policy statement place a number of
restrictions on the activities of WMB's and WMBFA's securities affiliates and on
such affiliates' transactions with WMB, WMBFA and WMBfsb. These restrictions
include requirements that such affiliates follow practices and procedures to
distinguish them from WMB, WMBFA and WMBfsb and that such affiliates give
customers notice from time to time of their separate corporate status and of the
distinction between insured deposits and uninsured nondeposit products.

     FDICIA imposes supervisory standards requiring periodic OTS or FDIC
examinations, independent audits, uniform accounting and management standards,
and prompt corrective action for problem institutions. As a result of FDICIA,
depository institutions and their affiliates are subject to federal standards
governing asset growth, interest rate exposure, executive compensation, and many
other areas of depository institution operations. FDICIA contains numerous other
provisions, including reporting requirements and revised regulatory standards
for, among other things, real estate lending.

     The FDIC may sanction any FDIC-regulated bank that does not operate in
accordance with FDIC regulations, policies and directives. Proceedings may be
instituted against any FDIC-regulated bank, or any institution-affiliated party,
such as a trustee, director, officer, employee, agent, or controlling person of
the bank, who engages in unsafe and unsound practices, including violations of
applicable laws and regulations. The FDIC may revalue assets of an institution,
based upon appraisals, and may require the establishment of

                                        19
<PAGE>   22

specific reserves in amounts equal to the difference between such revaluation
and the book value of the assets. The State Director has similar authority under
Washington state law, and the OTS has similar authority under HOLA. The FDIC has
additional authority to terminate insurance of accounts, after notice and
hearing, upon a finding that the insured institution is or has engaged in any
unsafe or unsound practice that has not been corrected, is operating in an
unsafe or unsound condition, or has violated any applicable law, regulation,
rule, or order of or condition imposed by the FDIC.

     Federal law and regulations require that WMBFA and WMBfsb maintain liquid
assets in excess of a specified limit. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity."

     Federal regulation of depository institutions is intended for the
protection of depositors (and the BIF and the SAIF), and not for the protection
of stockholders or other creditors. In addition, a provision in the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ("Budget Act") requires that in any
liquidation or other resolution of any FDIC-insured depository institution,
claims for administrative expenses of the receiver and for deposits in U.S.
branches (including claims of the FDIC as subrogee of the insured institution)
shall have priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors.

  Federal Reserve Regulation

     Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, WMB, WMBFA and WMBfsb are each
required to maintain a reserve against their transaction accounts (primarily
interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing checking accounts). Because reserves
must generally be maintained in cash or in noninterest-bearing accounts, the
effect of the reserve requirements is to increase an institution's cost of
funds. These regulations generally require that WMB, WMBFA and WMBfsb each
maintain reserves against net transaction accounts in the amount of 3% on
amounts of $44.3 million or less, plus 10% on amounts in excess of $44.3
million. Institutions may designate and exempt $5.0 million of certain
reservable liabilities from these reserve requirements. These amounts and
percentages are subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve Board. A savings
bank, like other depository institutions maintaining reservable accounts, may
borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window, but the Federal Reserve
Board's regulations require the savings bank to exhaust other reasonable
alternative sources before borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank.

     Numerous other regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board affect
the business operations of our banking subsidiaries. These include regulations
relating to equal credit opportunity, electronic fund transfers, collection of
checks, truth in lending, truth in savings and availability of funds.

  Federal Home Loan Bank System

     The FHLB System was created in 1932 and consists of twelve regional FHLBs.
The FHLBs are federally chartered but privately owned institutions created by
Congress. The Federal Housing Finance Board ("Finance Board") is an agency of
the federal government and is generally responsible for regulating the FHLB
System. Each FHLB is owned by its member institutions. The primary purpose of
the FHLBs is to provide funding to their members for making housing loans as
well as for affordable housing and community development lending. FHLBs are
generally able to make advances to their member institutions at interest rates
that are lower than could otherwise be obtained by such institutions.

     Under current rules, an FHLB member is generally required to purchase FHLB
stock in an amount equal to at least 5% of the aggregate outstanding advances
made by the FHLB to the member. The GLB Act and new regulations adopted by the
Finance Board in December 2000 require a new capital structure for the FHLBs.
The new capital structure will contain risk-based and leverage capital
requirements similar to those currently in place for depository institutions.
Each FHLB must submit a capital structure plan to the Finance Board for approval
within 270 days of the publication of the new regulations.

     Generally, an institution is eligible to be a member of the FHLB for the
district where the member's principal place of business is located. WMBFA, whose
home office is Stockton, California, is a member of the San Francisco FHLB; WMB,
whose head office is in Seattle, is a member of the Seattle FHLB, as is

                                        20
<PAGE>   23

WMBfsb, whose home office is in Salt Lake City. Prior to its merger with WMBFA,
Bank United was a member of the Dallas FHLB. Under Finance Board regulations,
Bank United membership terminated when it merged into WMBFA. The Federal Home
Loan Bank Act provides, however, for membership of the FHLB adjoining the
district in which an institution is located if membership is demanded by
convenience and approved by the Finance Board. WMBFA has applied to become a
member of the Dallas FHLB. The Dallas FHLB has approved the application
contingent upon the approval of the Finance Board.

  Community Reinvestment Act

     The Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") requires financial institutions
regulated by the federal financial supervisory agencies to ascertain and help
meet the credit needs of their delineated communities, including low- to
moderate-income neighborhoods within those communities, while maintaining safe
and sound banking practices. The regulatory agency assigns one of four possible
ratings to an institution's CRA performance and is required to make public an
institution's rating and written evaluation. The four possible ratings of
meeting community credit needs are outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve,
and substantial noncompliance. In 1999, WMBFA and WMBfsb each received an
"outstanding" CRA rating from the OTS, and WMB received an "outstanding" CRA
rating from the FDIC. These ratings reflect our commitment to meeting the credit
needs of the communities we serve.

     Under regulations that apply to all CRA performance evaluations after July
1, 1997, many factors play a role in assessing a financial institution's CRA
performance. The institution's regulator must consider its financial capacity
and size, legal impediments, local economic conditions and demographics,
including the competitive environment in which it operates. The evaluation does
not rely on absolute standards, and the institutions are not required to perform
specific activities or to provide specific amounts or types of credit. We
maintain a CRA file available for public viewing, as well as an annual CRA
highlights document. These documents describe our credit programs and services,
community outreach activities, public comments and other efforts to meet
community credit needs.

     In May 1998, we announced a ten-year $120 billion community commitment to
all areas in which we conduct business. The commitment replaced prior ones made
by us and the companies we acquired.

     The $120 billion commitment targets single-family, small business and
consumer, and multi-family lending, and community investment at the following
levels:

     - Single-family lending -- $81.6 billion in affordable housing loans to
       minority racial and ethnic borrowers, borrowers in low- to
       moderate-income ("LMI") census tracts, and borrowers earning less than
       80% of median income. Of this amount, $30 billion is specifically
       targeted to LMI borrowers.

     - Small business and consumer lending -- $25 billion in loans to small
       businesses and LMI consumers, including:

       - Consumer loans and lines of credit to borrowers with low-to
         moderate-incomes and in LMI census tracts, and

       - Small businesses, with an emphasis on loans and lines of credit of
         $50,000 or less and loans to people of color, women and disabled
         persons.

     - Multi-family lending -- $12.1 billion for multi-family structures,
       including (among others) apartment and manufactured home park
       developments, in LMI census tracts or serving families earning less than
       80% of median income.

     - Community investment -- $1.3 billion in investments and loans for
       community development. This commitment area includes low-income housing
       initiatives, tax-exempt housing revenue bonds, minority financial
       institutions and community banks and financial institutions targeting
       minority racial and ethnic communities or other community needs.

     In addition to these goals and objectives, we made a commitment (along with
pledges in other areas, like diversity) to philanthropically support the
communities in which we conduct our business. Towards that end

                                        21
<PAGE>   24

we "will strive to return" to our neighborhoods the greater of 2% of our pre-tax
earnings or 3% of our after-tax earnings plus 10% of any net recovery from the
resolution of Ahmanson's goodwill litigation against the U.S. government. This
corporate support is returned through grants, sponsorships, loans at below
market rates, in-kind donations, paid employee volunteer time, and other
financial support of our efforts to develop our communities.

     As of December 31, 2000, we exceeded our 2000 targets for lending in LMI
neighborhoods and underserved market areas in the second year of our $120
billion, ten-year commitment in loans and investments.

  Recent and Proposed Legislation and Regulation

     The GLB Act is summarized in "Regulation and Supervision -- General." The
new capital structure for FHLBs is summarized in "Regulation and
Supervision -- Federal Home Loan Bank System."

     In February 1999, the OTS proposed a regulation that could affect WMI's
treatment as a unitary savings and loan holding company. If a holding company
owns more than one savings association, it is a multiple savings and loan
holding company ("SLHC"); if it owns only one savings association, it is a
unitary SLHC. HOLA generally restricts multiple SLHCs and their non-association
subsidiaries to traditional savings association activities and services and to
activities permitted bank holding companies. These restrictions do not apply to
unitary SLHCs. In addition, these restrictions do not apply to a multiple SLHC
if all, or all but one, of its subsidiary savings associations were acquired in
transactions involving a sale or transfer from an ailing or failing institution.
Such savings associations are sometimes referred to as "supervisory"
acquisitions, and a multiple SLHC is sometimes referred to as an "exempt"
multiple SLHC if all, or all but one, of its subsidiary associations are
supervisory acquisitions. The OTS proposal stated that, under certain
circumstances, an exempt multiple SLHC could lose its exempt status if it or one
of its supervisory subsidiary associations is involved in a merger. This
proposal has been withdrawn by the OTS. The OTS may, however, issue the same or
a similar proposal in the future.

     WMI has had the status of an exempt multiple SLHC because two of its three
subsidiary associations -- WMBFA and WMBfsb -- have been deemed supervisory
acquisitions. However, both WMBFA and WMBfsb, as well as WMI, have been involved
in subsequent merger transactions. Accordingly, it is possible that, if the
proposed regulation or a similar regulation were adopted, the OTS could assert
that WMI is not an exempt multiple SLHC. If that were to occur, WMI would have
to merge its subsidiary associations or discontinue activities, including real
estate development activities not permitted to multiple SLHCs.

     The OTS and other banking regulators proposed revisions to their capital
rules concerning the treatment of residual interests in asset securitizations
and other transfers of financial assets. Generally, the proposed rule would
require that risk-based capital be held in an amount equal to the amount of
residual interests retained on an institution's balance sheet and would limit
the amount of residual interests that may be included in Tier 1 capital.

     The OTS has proposed a regulation which would require certain SLHCs to
notify the OTS before engaging in or committing to engage in a limited set of
debt transactions, transactions that reduce capital, some asset acquisitions,
and other transactions. In addition, while the regulation does not propose
capital requirements applicable to all SLHCs, the OTS is considering whether to
adopt a rule setting forth the circumstances in which it would review, on a
case-by-case basis, the capital adequacy of an SLHC and, when necessary, require
additional capital.

     In January 2001, the four federal banking agencies jointly issued expanded
examination and supervision guidance relating to subprime lending activities. In
the guidance, "subprime" lending generally refers to programs that target
borrowers with weakened credit histories or lower repayment capacity. The
guidance principally applies to institutions with subprime lending programs with
an aggregate credit exposure equal to or greater than 25 percent of an
institution's Tier 1 capital. Such institutions would be subject to more
stringent risk management standards and, in many cases, additional capital
requirements. As a starting point, the guidance generally expects that such an
institution would hold capital against subprime portfolios in an

                                        22
<PAGE>   25

amount that is one and one half to three times greater than the amount
appropriate for similar types of non-subprime assets.

     The guidance is primarily directed at insured depository institutions.
WMBFA currently holds specialty mortgage finance loans in excess of 25 percent
of its Tier 1 capital and could be adversely affected by the application of the
guidance. A significant portion of these loans and the consumer finance loans
originated by Washington Mutual Finance may be considered subprime loans under
the guidance. While WMI, Long Beach Mortgage and Washington Mutual Finance are
not currently subject to any specific capital requirements imposed by the
federal banking agencies, the OTS does have certain examination authority over
WMI in its capacity as an SLHC and, accordingly, WMI and its nonbanking
subsidiaries could also be adversely affected by the guidance. Management is
currently analyzing the impact of the guidance on the conduct of its business.

     In December 2000, the Federal Reserve Board published proposed regulations
which would implement the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act ("HOEPA").
 HOEPA, which was enacted in 1994, imposes additional disclosure requirements
and certain substantive limitations on certain mortgage loans with rates or fees
above specified levels. The proposed regulations would lower the rate levels
that trigger the application of HOEPA and would include additional fees in the
calculation of the fee amount that triggers HOEPA. The loans Washington Mutual
currently makes are generally below the rate and fee levels that trigger HOEPA.
However, if the changes to the rate levels and the calculation of fee amounts in
the proposed regulation are adopted, more of the loans we currently offer would
be subject to HOEPA.

  Regulation of Nonbanking Affiliates

     As broker-dealers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
and as members of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"),
WM Financial Services and our mutual fund distributor subsidiary are subject to
various regulations and restrictions imposed by those entities, as well as by
various state authorities. As our registered investment advisor, WM Advisors is
subject to various federal and state securities regulations and restrictions.

     The NASD has adopted rules concerning NASD member operations conducted in
branches of depository institutions. The NASD requirements are substantially
similar to the policy statements governing the activities of our securities
affiliates previously issued by the various banking regulators.

     Our consumer finance subsidiaries are subject to various federal and state
laws and regulations, including those relating to truth-in-lending, equal credit
opportunity, fair credit reporting, real estate settlement procedures, debt
collection practices and usury. The subsidiaries are subject to various state
licensing and examination requirements.

  Preferred Stock

     At December 31, 2000, we had no preferred stock outstanding.

  Payment of Dividends and Policy

     Payment of future dividends is subject to declaration by the Board of
Directors. Factors considered in determining the size of dividends are the
amount and stability of profits, adequacy of capitalization, and expected asset
and deposit growth of our subsidiaries. Our dividend policy is also dependent on
the ability of WMB, WMBFA and WMBfsb to pay dividends to their respective parent
company, which is influenced by legal, regulatory and economic restrictions. See
"Business -- Regulation and Supervision -- Restrictions on Subsidiary Savings
Institution Dividends."

     Our retained earnings at December 31, 2000 included a pre-1988 thrift bad
debt reserve for tax purposes of $2.01 billion for which no federal income taxes
have been provided. In the future, if the thrift bad debt reserve is used for
any purpose other than to absorb bad debt losses, or if any of the banking
subsidiaries no longer qualifies as a bank, we will incur a federal income tax
liability, at the then prevailing corporate tax rate, to the extent of such
subsidiaries' pre-1988 thrift bad debt reserve. As a result, our ability to pay
dividends in excess of current earnings may be limited.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

     The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto presented elsewhere in
this report.

     This section contains forward-looking statements, which are not historical
facts and pertain to our future operating results. These forward-looking
statements are within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,
statements about our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other
statements contained in this report that are not historical facts. When used in
this report, the words "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes,"
"seeks," "estimates" and similar expressions are generally intended to identify
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are inherently
subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and
contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these
forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future
business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. Actual results may
differ materially from the results discussed in these forward-looking statements
for the reasons, among others, discussed under the heading "Factors That May
Affect Future Results" included in this Form 10-K.

     Our net income for 2000 was $1.90 billion, compared with $1.82 billion in
1999 and $1.49 billion in 1998. We had diluted earnings per share of $3.54 in
2000, $3.16 in 1999 and $2.56 in 1998.

     During 2000, one of management's goals was to decrease the proportion of
SFR loans on our balance sheet by selling SFR loans and MBS. We continued our
policy of selling substantially all of our fixed-rate SFR originations and the
specialty mortgage finance loans originated by our subsidiary, Long Beach
Mortgage. We also began to sell ARM loans in the secondary market. In order to
achieve optimum pricing, current ARM production that is not held in the loan
portfolio is either sold to investors shortly following origination or
securitized and retained in the available-for-sale securities portfolio for a
period of time, and then sold. As a result of this initiative, we sold $18.07
billion of adjustable-rate loans during 2000. This strategy of selling current
ARM production or securitizing and retaining as securities for sale at a later
time resulted in an increase in the balance of loans held for sale to $3.40
billion at December 31, 2000, from $794 million at year-end 1999.

     Growing noninterest income is an important part of our strategy to reduce
our exposure to changes in interest rates. During 2000, noninterest income
represented 32% of total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income),
compared with 25% for 1999. We increased the amount of noninterest income
relative to net interest income by producing gains on sales of loans and
increasing our loan servicing income, as well as increasing depositor and other
retail banking fees.

     We also expanded our capability to generate loans. Total loan volume
increased by $7.07 billion from 1999 to 2000. To further mitigate our exposure
to adverse changes in interest rates, we increased our originations of non-SFR
loans to 29% of total originations during 2000, compared with 22% for the prior
year. We also purchased specialty mortgage finance and commercial loans to
further diversify our balance sheet. These loans have the benefit of yielding
wider margins, compared with our traditional home mortgage products. These
specialty mortgage finance and commercial loans also have more predictable and
stable prepayment rates. The characteristics of these portfolios should mitigate
our exposure to margin compression during periods of rising interest rates. As
this strategy also increases our credit risk, management closely monitors the
performance of these loans.

     Starting in 1998 and continuing in 1999, we purchased shorter duration
investment grade MBS in the secondary market. The MBS had acceptable, but lower
returns than loans originated by us and held in our portfolio. After reviewing
first quarter 1999 results, management re-evaluated our capital deployment
strategy. In April 1999, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase
program and MBS purchases were curtailed. From the second quarter of 1999
through June 30, 2000, we purchased a total of 66.3 million shares as part of
our previously announced repurchase programs totaling 111.3 million shares. We
have not

                                        29
<PAGE>   32

repurchased any of our common stock since the second quarter of 2000. Management
instead focused on internal growth and acquisitions as a means of deploying
capital.

     On January 31, 2001, we acquired the mortgage operations of The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc. The principal subsidiaries acquired in that
transaction were renamed Washington Mutual Home Loans, Inc. ("WMHLI") and
Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp. ("WMMSC"). The acquisition further
diversifies our mortgage operations geographically and expands our loan
origination, servicing and securitization capacity. At January 31, 2001, WMHLI
and WMMSC had total assets of approximately $7 billion.

     On February 9, 2001, we acquired Bank United Corp. This acquisition
enhances our existing plans to grow our commercial business and expands our
ability to originate FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed loans. At February 9, 2001,
Bank United Corp. had total assets of approximately $18 billion.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

  Net Interest Income

     Net interest income was $4.31 billion for 2000, compared with $4.45 billion
in 1999 and $4.29 billion in 1998. The decline in net interest income for 2000
was due to the decrease in the net interest spread and margin, partially offset
by an increase in average interest-earning assets. The net interest spread and
margin were 2.25% and 2.38% for 2000, compared with 2.48% and 2.63% for 1999.
The net interest spread and margin were 2.70% and 2.88% for 1998.

     The compression in the net interest spread and margin was primarily due to
the fact that our liabilities reprice to market rates more quickly than our
assets. This compression was in response to the rising interest rate environment
during the first half of 2000, evidenced by an increase in the average
three-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") from 6.14% in the fourth
quarter of 1999 to 6.70% in the third quarter of 2000, and by a 100 basis point
increase in the federal funds rate from 5.50% in November 1999 to 6.50% in May
2000. Accordingly, the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities increased 71
basis points to 5.37% for 2000 from 4.66% for 1999. This increase was primarily
due to a 91 basis point increase in the cost of our borrowings from 5.52% in
1999 to 6.43% in 2000. The increased usage of wholesale borrowings (our primary
funding source for asset growth) also contributed to the higher borrowing
expense. The cost of our interest-bearing liabilities and cost of borrowings
were 4.83% and 5.85% for 1998.

     Interest rates stabilized during the latter half of 2000, which caused an
improvement in the net interest margin during the fourth quarter. The net
interest spread and margin rose to 2.29% and 2.42% for the fourth quarter,
compared with 2.19% and 2.31% for the third quarter. Reflecting this lower
interest rate environment, adjustable-rate SFR loan originations were 76% of
total SFR originations for the fourth quarter of 2000, as compared with an
average of 88% over the prior three quarters.

     The overall yield on our interest-earning assets increased 48 basis points
during 2000, driven primarily by a 57 basis point increase in the yield on our
loans to 7.97%, compared with 7.40% for 1999. The rise in the yield on our loan
portfolio was the result of adjustments to variable-rate loans tied to
treasury-based indices and COFI. For the same reasons, there was a 36 basis
point increase in the yield on our other interest-earning assets to 6.97% for
2000, compared with 6.61% for 1999. For 1998, the overall yield on our
interest-earning assets was 7.53%, which was primarily attributable to the 7.73%
yield on our loan portfolio.

     With the reduction in the federal funds rate to 5.50% in January 2001,
coupled with the "snap back" effect on our ARM portfolio from the rate increases
during the first half of 2000, we anticipate an improvement in the net interest
margin during 2001. If interest rates remain stable or decline further, then the
net interest margin could expand even further. If further rate reductions do
occur, we may adopt the strategy of extending the maturity range of our
wholesale borrowings and increasing our holdings of interest rate cap contracts
embedded within these liabilities. Restructuring this portfolio in such a manner
would reduce our exposure to margin compression during periods of rising
interest rates.

     The dollar amounts of interest income and interest expense fluctuate
depending upon changes in interest rates and upon changes in amounts (volume) of
our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Changes
attributable to (i) changes in volume (changes in average outstanding balances
multiplied by the prior period's rate), (ii) changes in rate (changes in average
interest rate multiplied by the prior period's volume), and (iii) changes in
rate/volume (changes in rate times the change in volume that were allocated
proportionately to the changes in volume and the changes in rate) were as

     Depositor and other retail banking fees of $976 million for 2000 increased
28% from $764 million for 1999 and 72% from $569 million for 1998. The increase
in 2000 was primarily due to higher collections of nonsufficient funds and other
fees on existing checking accounts from higher customer usage and fee increases.
The increase from 1998 to 1999 was primarily due to collecting more debit card,
ATM, nonsufficient funds and other fees that resulted from an increased number
of checking accounts. The number of checking accounts increased by more than
500,000 during 2000 to 4.8 million accounts at December 31, 2000 and over
400,000 during 1999 to 4.3 million accounts at December 31, 1999.

     Securities fees and commissions increased to $318 million for 2000 from
$271 million in 1999 and $192 million in 1998. During 2000, we earned more
investment management fees due to the growth in assets under management in the
WM Group of Funds. Assets under management grew from $7.42 billion at December
31, 1999 to $8.21 billion at December 31, 2000. Higher volume of securities
transactions in 2000 also contributed to the increase in fee income.

     Loan servicing income increased to $147 million in 2000, compared with $112
million in 1999 and $117 million in 1998. The increase was primarily due to
growth in loans serviced for others as a result of loan sales and
securitizations. The impact of this portfolio growth was partially offset by an
increase in the amortization of mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") primarily
resulting from the larger servicing portfolio. We also incurred an MSR
impairment of $9 million during the fourth quarter of 2000 due to an increase in
prepayment estimates as a result of falling long-term interest rates. The
weighted average servicing fee was approximately 43 basis points during 2000 and
39 basis points during 1999.

     Loan related income was $117 million in 2000, up from $103 million in 1999
and $111 million in 1998. This income is comprised of late charges, prepayment
fees, reconveyance fees, and other miscellaneous fees. The increase in income
from 1999 to 2000 resulted from increased volume of late charges on the loan
portfolio and higher prepayment fees on the purchased specialty mortgage finance
portfolio as the result of increased refinancing activity. The decrease in
income from 1998 to 1999 was due to the rise in interest rates, which caused a
decline in loan prepayments and the related prepayment fees. Late charges also
decreased as a result of a downward trend in delinquencies.

     Gain on sale of loans increased to $262 million for 2000, compared with
$109 million in 1999 and $133 million in 1998. The gain for 2000 was
attributable to the sale of fixed- and adjustable-rate loans, which included
$12.90 billion of seasoned loans and $8.71 billion of current loan production.
Additionally, we sold $3.74 billion of loans originated by Long Beach Mortgage.
The gains for 1999 and 1998 resulted from sales of $8.96 billion and $18.24
billion of current loan production, which were comprised of fixed-rate loans.
Sales of loans originated by Long Beach Mortgage contributed $23 million towards
the 1999 gains.

     Losses from securities were $1 million during 2000, compared with $12
million during 1999 and $30 million during 1998. During the first half of 2000,
we incurred net losses on MBS sales. The proceeds from these sales were used to
repurchase our common stock. These sales also reduced our interest rate
sensitivity. Substantially offsetting these losses were $9 million in gains from
the sale of ARM loan originations in 2000 that were securitized and held in the
available-for-sale securities portfolio for a period of time prior to being
sold, as well as $9 million in gains from the sale of securities that were
purchased as hedges against our MSR portfolio.

</TABLE>

     Compensation and benefits expense increased to $1.35 billion, compared with
$1.19 billion for both 1999 and 1998. A significant portion of the increase was
due to increased commission expense resulting from the higher volume of loan
originations and securities transactions. Other significant factors were
increases in base compensation expense and higher premiums on employee medical
and dental insurance. Also contributing to the increase was the acquisition of
Long Beach Mortgage in October 1999, which was not included in our results prior
to its acquisition. Full-time equivalent employees ("FTE") were 28,798 at
December 31, 2000, compared with 28,509 at December 31, 1999 and 27,957 at
December 31, 1998.

     Occupancy and equipment expense was $604 million in 2000, compared with
$565 million for 1999 and $498 million for 1998. The increase during 2000 was
primarily due to higher rent and depreciation expense that resulted from
additional building leases and the leasehold improvements thereon, and computer
equipment upgrades. Similar computer system upgrades caused an increase in
equipment expense during 1999, partially offset by occupancy expense reductions
from the closure of 162 consumer financial centers in California as a result of
the merger with Ahmanson.

     Telecommunications and outsourced information services expense was $323
million in 2000, compared with $276 million in 1999 and $256 million in 1998. In
2000, the increase reflected higher use of services resulting from additional
locations, higher levels of customer support, and increased use of outsourced
data processing. During 2000, the opening of 26 financial centers in new
markets, in conjunction with project Occasio(TM) as well as the development of
Optis(TM), also contributed to higher telecommunications expense.

     We completed the integration of Ahmanson in the fourth quarter of 1999. As
a result, there were no transaction-related expenses incurred in 2000.

                                        34
<PAGE>   37

     Advertising and promotion expense increased to $132 million in 2000 from
$111 million in 1999 and $114 million in 1998. The increase during 2000 was
primarily due to additional costs associated with campaigns for various loan and
deposit products. In 1998, we incurred additional costs associated with
campaigns designed to introduce products to the California market.

     Professional fees for 2000 were $101 million, compared with $70 million in
1999 and $61 million in 1998. The 2000 increase was attributable to various
consulting projects designed to streamline our processes and procedures, and to
develop and deliver new products.

     Regulatory assessments were $31 million in 2000, compared with $59 million
in 1999 and $63 million in 1998. The overall assessment rate for Savings
Association Insurance Fund deposits was significantly reduced in the first
quarter of 2000, which caused a corresponding decrease in regulatory
assessments. See "Business -- Regulation and Supervision -- FDIC Insurance."

     Other expense increased to $185 million in 2000 from $166 million in 1999.
The increase of $19 million during 2000 was mainly comprised of increases in
loan expenses, contributions, and other outside services. The higher loan
expenses in 2000 were attributable to an overall increase in loan originations
and purchases. The decrease from 1998 to 1999 was due to 1998 expenses
associated with the donation of land for open space to support further
development of property owned by Ahmanson as a real estate investment.

  Taxation

     Income taxes include federal and applicable state income taxes and payments
in lieu of taxes. The provision for income taxes was $1.09 billion for 2000,
which represented an effective tax rate of 36.37%.

     In connection with the Keystone Transaction, we acquired ASB. ASB was
formed to effect the December 1988 acquisition (the "1988 Acquisition") of
certain assets and liabilities of the failed savings and loan association
subsidiary of Financial Corporation of America. In connection with the 1988
Acquisition, the Internal Revenue Service (the "Service") entered into a closing
agreement (the "Closing Agreement") with respect to the federal income tax
consequences of the 1988 Acquisition and certain aspects of the taxation of
Keystone Holdings and certain of its affiliates. The Closing Agreement contains
provisions that were intended to ensure that losses generated by New West
Federal Savings and Loan Association would be available to offset income of ASB
for federal income tax purposes. In connection with the 1988 Acquisition,
Keystone Holdings and certain of its affiliates entered into a number of
continuing agreements with the predecessor to the FDIC, including an Assistance
Agreement.

     See "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Note 12: Income Taxes."

REVIEW OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Assets. At December 31, 2000, our assets were $194.72 billion, an increase
of $8.21 billion or 4% from $186.51 billion at December 31, 1999. This increase
primarily resulted from the retention of loans originated by us, either as loans
or in securitized form, and the purchase of whole loans. In particular, loans
held for sale and loans held in portfolio increased by $2.61 billion and $5.88
billion.

     Securities. Our securities portfolio decreased by $2.07 billion or 3% to
$58.72 billion at December 31, 2000 from $60.79 billion at year-end 1999. The
decrease was primarily due to principal paydowns and sales of MBS that had been
purchased in 1998 and the first half of 1999, partially offset by the retention
of MBS that were created from loan securitizations. In 2001, we expect to
increase our purchases of other investment securities, such as government bonds.
These bonds have fixed-maturities, are non-callable and non-prepayable and are
expected to serve as economic hedges of mortgage servicing rights, which are
subject to prepayment risk in a declining interest rate environment.

     At December 31, 2000, we held $21.99 billion of private issue MBS and CMOs.
Of this total, 73% were rated the highest investment grade (AAA), 3% were rated
investment grade (AA through BBB), 1% were rated below investment grade and 23%
were unrated.

                                        35
<PAGE>   38

     At December 31, 2000, 60% of MBS were adjustable rate. Of the 60% indexed
to an adjustable rate, 52% were indexed to COFI, 34% to U.S. Treasury indices,
and 14% to other indices. The remaining 40% of MBS were fixed-rate.

     Loans. Total loans at December 31, 2000 were $123.03 billion, up $8.49
billion or 7% from $114.54 billion at December 31, 1999. This increase was
primarily due to growth in ARM, second mortgage and other consumer, and
specialty mortgage finance loans. These increases were partially offset by sales
and securitizations of SFR loans as well as principal payments. During 2000, we
expanded our capacity to generate loans and developed a market to sell ARM
loans, in addition to our ongoing policy of selling fixed-rate loans. This was
done as part of our strategy to remix the balance sheet and to become less
reliant on net interest income by increasing gain on sale of loans and loan
servicing income. Our current strategy is to hold newly originated monthly
adjustable-rate loans during periods of high prepayment activity and sell a
sufficient amount during periods of low prepayment activity to stabilize balance
sheet growth over time. This strategy of selling current ARM production or
securitizing and retaining as securities for sale at a later time resulted in an
increase in the balance of loans held for sale to $3.40 billion at December 31,
2000, from $794 million at year-end 1999.

     Loans (exclusive of the allowance for loan and lease losses) consisted of

</TABLE>

     We have been diversifying our SFR loans by product type from a COFI
concentration to Treasury-based. This diversification reduces our interest rate
risk because Treasury-based loans have repricing frequencies that more closely
match the repricing of our borrowings. This diversification is achieved through
the securitization and sale of COFI-based loans and paydowns of portfolio loans
indexed to COFI. At December 31, 2000, 88% of SFR loans were adjustable rate, of
which 66% were indexed to U.S. Treasury indices, 28% were indexed to COFI, and
6% to other indices. The remaining 12% of the SFR loan portfolio at year-end
2000 were fixed rate. At December 31, 1999, 85% of SFR loans were adjustable
rate, of which 52% were indexed to U.S. Treasury indices, 42% were indexed to
COFI, and 6% to other indices. The remaining 15% of the year-end 1999 SFR loan
portfolio were fixed rate.

     Our loan originations increased 15% to $59.26 billion in 2000 from $51.59
billion the year before. In particular, originations of short-term ARMs, which
reprice primarily on a monthly basis, increased to $31.65 billion in 2000,
compared with $15.24 billion in 1999. The increase in short-term ARM
originations in 2000 was attributable to the higher interest rate environment
during the first half of 2000 and customer preference for short-term ARMs over
fixed-rate loans.

     We purchased $6.75 billion of loans in 2000, compared with $7.36 billion in
1999 and $3.07 billion in 1998. Of the 2000 purchases, $4.01 billion were
specialty mortgage finance loans with a weighted average yield of 8.50%. The
1999 purchases included $3.30 billion of specialty mortgage finance loans with a
weighted average yield of 8.70%.

     Real estate construction (including SFR construction and commercial real
estate construction) and commercial business loans by maturity date were as

     MSR increased to $1.02 billion at December 31, 2000 from $643 million at
December 31, 1999. Additions of $516 million to MSR during the year were
primarily due to loan sales and securitizations. The acquisitions of Bank United
Corp. and the mortgage operations of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. adds
about $2 billion of MSR to our balance sheet.

     Deposits. Deposits declined slightly to $79.57 billion at December 31, 2000
from $81.13 billion at December 31, 1999.

     Our goal is to increase the ratio of transaction accounts to total
deposits. As a result, savings accounts, MMDAs and checking accounts have
increased to 57% of total deposits at year-end 2000, compared with 54% at
year-end 1999. These three products have the benefit of interest-free funding or
lower costs, compared with time deposit accounts. Even though transaction
accounts are more liquid, we consider them to be a core relationship with our
customers. In the aggregate, we view these core accounts to be a more stable
source of long-term funding than time deposits.

     Time deposit accounts in amounts of $100,000 or more totaled $8.75 billion
and $8.84 billion at December 31, 2000 and 1999. At December 31, 2000, $3.14
billion of these deposits mature within three months, $2.02 billion mature in
over three to six months, $2.63 billion mature in over six months to one year,
and $962 million mature after one year.

     While the vast majority of our deposits are retail in nature, we do engage
in certain wholesale activities -- primarily accepting time deposits from
political subdivisions and public agencies. We consider wholesale deposits to be
an alternative borrowing source rather than a customer relationship, and as
such, their levels are determined by management's decision as to the most
economic funding sources.

     Borrowings. Our borrowings primarily take the form of repurchase agreements
and advances from the FHLBs of Seattle and San Francisco. The exact mix at any
given time is dependent upon the market pricing of the individual borrowing
sources.

     Our wholesale borrowing portfolio increased by $3.60 billion at December
31, 2000, compared with the prior year. Other borrowings also increased by $3.73
billion over December 31, 1999. These increases in funding were used primarily
to support asset growth.

     Certain portions of the repurchase agreements and advances from FHLBs
contain embedded derivatives. See "Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements -- Note 9: Repurchase Agreements and Note 10: Advances from FHLBs."

PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES

     The allowance for loan and lease losses represents management's estimate of
credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolios. Management performs
periodic reviews of the portfolios in order to identify these inherent losses,
and to assess the overall probability of collection of these portfolios. The
process by which the allowance is determined encompasses the analysis of the
historical performance of each loan category and an assessment of current
economic and portfolio trends and conditions, as well as specific risk factors
impacting the loan and lease portfolios. We monitor delinquency, default, and
loss rates, among other factors impacting portfolio risk. In addition,
non-homogeneous type loans, such as commercial business and commercial real
estate loans, are reviewed on an individual loan basis in order to identify
impairment, and for risk rating purposes.

     As of December 31, 2000, 76% of the allowance was allocated to individual
loans or loan categories, although the entire allowance was available for charge
offs across the entire loan and lease portfolio.

     During the second quarter of 2000, in conjunction with our continued
expansion of our lending activity beyond traditional SFR loans, management
enhanced its methodology for determining the allocated components of the
allowance. This enhancement resulted in an allocation of previously unallocated
allowance amounts to individual loan categories. Portions of the allowance for
loan and lease losses are now allocated to cover estimated losses inherent in
each loan and lease category as well as to individual loans. Management also
maintains an unallocated component of the allowance to cover estimated credit
losses not fully considered in the allocated portion of the allowance. Factors
impacting the level of the unallocated component include modeling deficiencies
resulting from the absence of comprehensive historical information, lack of
credit performance data related to newly developed loan products or programs,
changes in underwriting standards and other factors impacting the estimation of
credit losses.

* Less than 1%.

     We record an allowance for recourse obligations to cover inherent losses on
loans securitized and retained in our MBS portfolio for which we retain the
credit risk, and to cover estimated losses on loans and MBS sold to third
parties for which a recourse obligation exists. A regular review is performed to
determine the adequacy of the allowance for recourse obligations. As of December
31, 2000, the allowance for recourse obligations totaled $104 million, compared
with $113 million at year-end 1999.

     The total loss coverage percentage is the allowance for loan and lease
losses and the allowance for recourse obligations as a percentage of nonaccrual
loans:

     At December 31, 2000 and 1999, we had $16.16 billion and $18.12 billion of
loans securitized and retained with recourse, and $4.06 billion and $4.65
billion of loans securitized and sold with recourse.

  Nonperforming Assets

     Assets considered to be nonperforming include nonaccrual loans and
foreclosed assets. When loans securitized or sold with recourse become
nonperforming, they are included in nonaccrual loans. Management generally
classifies loans as nonaccrual if the timely collection of principal and
interest is not expected, any portion of the loan has been charged off, or the
loan is four payments or more past due.

     Nonperforming assets were $1.04 billion or 0.53% of total assets at
December 31, 2000, compared with $1.03 billion or 0.55% of total assets at
year-end 1999.

     If interest on nonaccrual loans had been recognized, such income would have
been $83 million in 2000, $67 million in 1999 and $66 million in 1998.

     Specialty mortgage finance loans on nonaccrual status increased by $122
million during 2000 and by $55 million during 1999 due to the continued growth
and seasoning of this portfolio. This increase in nonaccrual loans was
consistent with our expectations. We expect the balance of nonaccrual loans to
increase as the portfolio continues to grow and season. The balance of specialty
mortgage finance loans increased to $7.26 billion at year-end 2000 from $4.45
billion at year-end 1999.

     Loans (exclusive of the allowance for loan and lease losses) and nonaccrual
loans by geographic concentration at December 31, 2000 were as follows:

(1) Of this category, Florida had the largest portfolio balance of approximately
    $4.94 billion.

     At December 31, 2000, nonaccrual loans in California accounted for 35% of
total nonaccrual loans, down from 49% in 1999. Due to the concentration of our
loans in California, the California real estate market

                                        41
<PAGE>   44

requires continual review. In general, real estate values have increased during
1998, 1999 and 2000. However, economic performance within California may vary
significantly among property types or by region.

  Impaired Loans

     Commercial real estate loans over $1 million and all commercial business
and builder construction loans are individually evaluated for impairment.
Management generally identifies loans to be evaluated for impairment when such
loans are on nonaccrual status or have been restructured. However, not all
nonaccrual loans are impaired. Loans are considered impaired when it is probable
that we will be unable to collect all amounts contractually due, including
scheduled interest payments. Restructured loans are evaluated for impairment
based on the contractual terms specified by the original loan agreement, rather
than the contractual terms specified by the restructuring agreement. Loans
performing under restructured terms beyond a specified performance period are
classified as accruing, but may still be deemed impaired. Factors involved in
determining impairment include, but are not limited to, the financial condition
of the borrower, the value of the underlying collateral, and current economic
conditions.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

     Effective January 1, 2001, we realigned our business segments. Separately,
we are in the process of enhancing our segment reporting process methodologies
and allocations and will be reporting segment results under these new
methodologies and as realigned beginning with the first quarter of 2001.

     For the historical periods presented in this Form 10-K, we managed our
business along five major operating segments: Consumer Banking, Mortgage
Banking, Commercial Banking, Financial Services, and Consumer Finance. Although
we did not consider the Treasury group to be an operating segment, it managed
investments and interest rate risk. Generally, MBS that we purchased were
allocated to Treasury. Refer to Note 23 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for summarized financial information for these operating
segments.

     Deposit accounts managed by the Western Bank/WM Business Bank division are
allocated to the commercial banking segment, and substantially all of the retail
consumer deposits are allocated to the consumer banking segment. The related
interest expense is allocated to those segments. The consumer banking segment
was allocated an amount of assets equal to the excess of its deposits over its
balance of consumer loans. The other segments were allocated an amount of
indebtedness in excess of deposits necessary to support the interest-earning
assets of the segment. The rate on such indebtedness was our weighted average
borrowing cost.

  Consumer Banking

     Net interest income was $2.50 billion in 2000, $2.49 billion in 1999, and
$2.56 billion in 1998. Net interest income for the consumer banking group
increased slightly from 1999 to 2000 primarily due to the increase in the net
interest spread and margin, whereas the decline from 1998 to 1999 was due to the
compression of the net interest spread and margin. The yield on the consumer
banking group's SFR and consumer loans responded more quickly than the cost of
deposits to the rise in short-term interest rates during the first half of 2000.
Noninterest income was $1.04 billion in 2000, $817 million in 1999, and $626
million in 1998. The rise in noninterest income during the comparative periods
resulted from an increase in depositor and other retail banking fees associated
with higher collections of nonsufficient funds and other fees on existing
checking accounts from higher customer usage and fee increases. The increase
from 1998 to 1999 was primarily due to collecting more debit card, ATM,
nonsufficient funds and other fees that resulted from an increased number of
checking accounts. The number of checking accounts increased by more than
500,000 during 2000 to 4.8 million accounts at December 31, 2000 and over
400,000 during 1999 to 4.3 million accounts at December 31, 1999.

  Mortgage Banking

     Net interest income was $741 million in 2000, $796 million in 1999, and
$833 million in 1998. The decline in net interest income during the comparative
periods was primarily due to the compression of the net interest spread and
margin in the mortgage banking group. The cost of borrowings for the mortgage
banking

                                        42
<PAGE>   45

group responded more quickly than the yield on ARMs to the rise in short-term
interest rates during the first half of 2000. In addition, the volume of
wholesale borrowings increased during 2000 to fund asset growth. Noninterest
income was $431 million in 2000, $259 million in 1999, and $326 million in 1998.
Noninterest income increased from 1999 to 2000 primarily as a result of
increased gain on sale of loans, loan servicing income, and other income. The
increase in gain on sale of loans was attributable to the sale of $12.90 billion
of seasoned loans and $8.71 billion of current loan production during 2000. The
increase in loan servicing income was primarily due to growth in loans serviced
for others as a result of loan sales and securitizations. The impact of this
portfolio growth was partially offset by an increase in mortgage servicing
rights amortization. The decline in noninterest income from 1998 to 1999 was due
to a decrease in loan servicing income and loan related income. In addition,
gain on sale of loans was lower in 1999 due to a decrease in fixed-rate loan
originations and sales.

     Total assets increased $8.61 billion, nearly 19%, to $54.98 billion at
December 31, 2000 from $46.37 billion at year-end 1999. This increase was
primarily due to an increase in MBS.

  Commercial Banking

     Net interest income was $362 million in 2000, $376 million in 1999, and
$368 million in 1998. The decline in net interest income from 1999 to 2000
resulted from the compression of the net interest spread and margin in the
commercial real estate portfolio. Repricing indices for the majority of the
commercial real estate portfolio responded more slowly to the rise in short-term
interest rates than the cost of borrowings. Net interest income was higher in
1999, compared with 1998, due to an increase in the net interest spread and
margin in the commercial real estate portfolio. Noninterest income was $34
million in 2000, $30 million in 1999, and $24 million in 1998. Noninterest
expense was $128 million in 2000, $104 million in 1999, and $101 million in
1998. The increase in noninterest expense during 2000 was primarily due to
higher compensation and benefits expense within commercial real estate lending
and as a result of our expansion of WM Business Bank offices in California.

  Financial Services

     Noninterest income was $371 million in 2000, $317 million in 1999, and $230
million in 1998. Noninterest income was up during the comparative periods due to
increased securities fees and commissions. During these periods, there were
higher sales of investment products and growth of assets under management.
Noninterest expense was $240 million in 2000, $200 million in 1999, and $165
million in 1998. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to an
increase in commission expense related to a higher volume of securities
transactions.

  Consumer Finance

     Net interest income was $354 million in 2000, $255 million in 1999, and
$203 million in 1998. The increase during the comparative periods was due to an
increase in the net interest spread and margin. Average loans increased as a
result of the growth in loans originated, purchases of specialty mortgage
finance loans, and the acquisition of Long Beach Mortgage on October 1, 1999.
Noninterest income was $141 million in 2000, $56 million in 1999, and $10
million in 1998. The increase during the comparative periods was primarily due
to an increase in gains on sales of loans originated by Long Beach Mortgage.
Noninterest expense was $274 million in 2000 compared with $164 million in 1999
and $127 million in 1998. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to the
inclusion of Long Beach Mortgage operating expenses.

     Total assets increased $2.88 billion to $10.25 billion at December 31, 2000
from $7.37 billion at year-end 1999. This increase was primarily due to
purchases of specialty mortgage finance loans, in addition to loans originated
and purchased by Washington Mutual Finance.

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY

     Our long-term profitability depends not only on the success of the services
we offer to our customers and the credit quality of our loans and securities,
but also the extent to which our earnings are not negatively affected by changes
in interest rates. We engage in a comprehensive asset and liability management
program that attempts to reduce the risk of significant decreases in net
interest income caused by interest rate changes

                                        43
<PAGE>   46

without unduly penalizing current earnings. As part of this strategy, we
actively manage the amounts and maturities of our assets and liabilities.

     A key component of our strategy is the origination and retention of
short-term and adjustable-rate assets whose repricing characteristics more
closely match the repricing characteristics of our liabilities. At December 31,
2000, approximately 78% of our total SFR loan and MBS portfolio had adjustable
rates.

     During periods of moderate to high market interest rates, our customers
prefer ARMs. ARMs are also well received whenever long-term rates remain
appreciably higher than short-term rates. During 2000, market interest rates
rose 50 to 100 basis points; and the difference between the yields on a
three-month U.S. Treasury bill and a ten-year U.S. Government note averaged 4
basis points, compared with 88 basis points in 1999. Even though short-term
rates were not significantly lower than long-term rates, 85% of our SFR loan
originations were ARMs, while 15% were fixed rate during 2000 due to higher
long-term rates compared with recent years.

     Prior to the upward trend in interest rates in late 1999 and 2000, a low
and flat yield curve and significant repricings during 1998 and early 1999
resulted in lowered asset yields. Subsequently, when short-term interest rates
rose, the higher funding costs compressed the net interest margin. This
compression began to lessen in the latter half of 2000 as interest rates
stabilized and the yield on assets tied to lagging market indices rose. We
estimate that it takes three to four quarters for asset yields to catch up with
increases in funding costs after an increase in short-term interest rates.
However, continued higher short-term rates during the latter half of 2000
limited the widening of the net interest margin.

     To manage the risk of timing differences in the repricing of assets and
liabilities, our interest-earning assets are matched with interest-bearing
liabilities that have similar repricing characteristics. For example, in
general, our fixed-rate loans are matched with long-term deposits and
borrowings, and our ARMs are matched with short-term deposits and borrowings.
Periodically, mismatches are identified and managed by adjusting the repricing
characteristics of our interest-bearing liabilities with derivatives.
Derivatives such as interest rate cap and exchange agreements are generally
utilized to match the duration of liabilities to that of the assets.

     We also continue to sell fixed-rate loans to adjust the balance between
interest-sensitive liabilities and interest-sensitive assets. During 2000, we
started to sell adjustable-rate loans with three-to five-year initial fixed
rates. To establish balance sheet flexibility and diversity, we also began to
sell some monthly option ARMs in 2000. We continued to purchase specialty
mortgage finance loans during 2000.

  Lag risk

     During 2000, lag risk was our primary interest rate risk. In times of
rising interest rates, we are negatively affected by an inherent timing
difference between the repricing of our adjustable-rate assets and our
liabilities. The effect of this timing difference, or "lag," will be favorable
during a period of declining interest rates. Although the effect of this lag
generally balances out over the life of a given loan, it can produce short-term
volatility in our net interest income during periods of interest rate movement.
One example of this is the delay in the repricing of COFI-based assets, commonly
referred to as "COFI lag." This lag results from the two-month delay in reported
COFI because of the time required to gather the data necessary to compute the
index. The COFI used to reprice ARMs and adjustable-rate MBS generally reflects
the cost of funds for a period two months prior to the adjustment date. As a
result, COFI loans reprice more slowly than our liabilities.

  Repricing risk

     Repricing risk is caused by the mismatch in the maturities or repricing
periods between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In
periods of rising interest rates, the net interest margin will compress if the
repricing period of liabilities is shorter than the repricing period of assets
because funding costs will rise faster than asset yields. The impact in periods
of falling interest rates would be positive. Repricing risk can be managed by
changing the repricing characteristics of interest-bearing liabilities with
derivatives.

                                        44
<PAGE>   47

  Prepayment risk

     In a declining interest rate environment with a flat yield curve,
customers' preference for fixed-rate loans usually results in the prepayment and
refinancing of existing loans, fixed-rate and ARMs, to lower coupon, fixed-rate
mortgage loans. This preference, when combined with our policy of selling most
of our fixed-rate loan production, may make it more difficult for us to increase
or even maintain the size of our loan and MBS portfolio during these periods.
During such periods, it is likely that we would continue to securitize ARMs, but
hold them in the portfolio, rather than selling them, to offset some of this
risk. When prepayments occur on our loan servicing portfolio, the value of MSR
may decline as servicing cash flows diminish. In addition, premiums related to
loans and MBS on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition must be
written off at the time of repayment and can have an adverse impact on earnings.

  Basis risk

     The repricing of our assets and liabilities is also at risk from interest
rate movements because generally our assets and liabilities are tied to a
variety of indices which may react differently to changes in interest rates.
Loans tied to the COFI index create a form of basis risk. Our general cost of
funds is higher than most other savings institutions whose costs are a component
of the COFI index because a larger portion of our liabilities are borrowings,
rather than lower costing deposits. To reduce basis risk, we offer the MTA loan.
This loan has all the same borrower advantages as the COFI product, such as a
7.5% annual payment cap and four payment options. However, the MTA loan is
indexed to the 12-month moving average of the one-year Treasury bills, which
more closely reflects our borrowing costs. Management has reduced potential net
interest income volatility caused by COFI basis risk by increasing production of
MTA and other non-COFI adjustable-rate products and short-term fixed-rate
products, such as consumer loans. There continues to be basis risk with the MTA
index, as it moves with the Treasury rates, and most of our borrowings are tied
to LIBOR indices.

     Borrowings are generally more rate sensitive than deposits and reprice more
quickly as market interest rates (such as treasury rates) change. To the extent
that loan indices move at a different rate or in a different direction from our
cost of funds, the general cost of funds basis risk may be realized.

  Loan indices

     As discussed previously, the majority of our loans and MBS have adjustable
rates that are tied to a market index. Our cost of funds (representing the cost
of total interest-bearing liabilities) compared to various indices was as
follows:

  Cap risk

     The lifetime interest rate caps that we offer to ARM borrowers introduce
another element of interest rate risk to our earnings. In periods of rising
interest rates, it is possible for the repriced interest rates (index rate plus
the margin) to exceed the lifetime interest caps of existing ARM loans.

LIQUIDITY

     Liquidity management focuses on the need to meet both short-term funding
requirements and long-term growth objectives. Our long-term growth objectives
are to attract and retain stable consumer deposit relationships and to maintain
stable sources of wholesale funds. Because the low interest rate environment of
recent years has inhibited growth of consumer deposits, we have supported our
growth through business combinations with other financial institutions and by
increasing our use of wholesale borrowings.

                                        45
<PAGE>   48

     We monitor our ability to meet short-term cash requirements using
guidelines established by our Boards of Directors. These guidelines ensure that
short-term secured borrowing capacity is sufficient to satisfy unanticipated
cash needs.

     As presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the sources of
liquidity vary between years. The statement of cash flows includes operating,
investing and financing categories. Cash flows from operating activities
included net income for 2000 of $1.90 billion, $503 million for net noncash
items and $881 million of other net cash inflows from operating activities. Cash
flows from investing activities consisted mainly of proceeds from sales and
purchases of securities, loan and security principal repayments, loan
originations and sales of loans. In 2000, cash flows from investing activities
included sales, maturities and principal payments on securities totaling $12.22
billion. Loans originated and purchased for investment were in excess of
repayments and sales by $15.86 billion. Cash flows from financing activities
consisted of the net change in our deposit accounts and short-term borrowings,
deposits sold, the proceeds and repayments of long-term borrowings and FHLBs
advances, and the repurchase of our common stock. In 2000, the above mentioned
financing activities increased cash and cash equivalents by $4.76 billion on a
net basis. Cash and cash equivalents were $2.62 billion at December 31, 2000.
See "Consolidated Financial Statements -- Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows."

     As of December 31, 2000, we had two revolving credit facilities: a $1.20
billion 364-day facility and a $600 million four-year facility, which provide
back-up for our commercial paper programs. At December 31, 2000, we had $841
million available under these facilities, which represents the total amount of
the two revolving credit facilities, net of the amount of commercial paper
outstanding at year end.

     With the acquisition of the mortgage operations of The PNC Financial
Services Group, Inc. on January 31, 2001, we paid off approximately $7 billion
of intercompany borrowings to their former parent company. The funds were
borrowed through additional advances from FHLBs and by federal funds purchased.

CAPITAL ADEQUACY

     Our capital (stockholders' equity) was $10.17 billion at December 31, 2000,
up from $9.05 billion at December 31, 1999. In order to effectively deploy
capital, we repurchased our common stock during the first half of 2000. During
the second half of 2000, we used capital to facilitate balance sheet growth and
retained additional capital in anticipation of completing the announced
acquisitions of Bank United Corp., WMHLI and WMMSC. The decrease in unrealized
loss on available-for-sale securities to $51 million at December 31, 2000 from
$667 million at December 31, 1999 in addition to net income of $1.90 billion for
2000 more than offset the stock repurchases during the first half of 2000. This
caused a rise in the ratio of stockholders' equity to total assets to 5.22% at
year-end 2000, compared with 4.85% at year-end 1999.

     The regulatory capital ratios of WMBFA, WMB and WMBfsb and minimum
regulatory requirements to be categorized as well capitalized were as follows:

</TABLE>

     Our federal savings bank subsidiaries are also required by OTS regulations
to maintain tangible capital of at least 1.50% of assets. WMBFA and WMBfsb both
satisfied this requirement at December 31, 2000.

     Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are also subject to capital requirements. At
December 31, 2000, both of our securities subsidiaries were in compliance with
their applicable capital requirements.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED IN THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities, was issued in September 2000 and replaces
SFAS No. 125 of the same title. This statement revises the standards for
accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and
collateral, and requires certain disclosures, but carries over most of SFAS No.
125's provisions without reconsideration. This

                                        46
<PAGE>   49

statement is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and
extinguishments of liabilities occurring after March 31, 2001 and is effective
for recognition and reclassification of collateral and for disclosures relating
to securitization transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2000. Our adoption of this statement is not expected to materially
affect our results of operations or financial condition. See "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements -- Note 3: Securities and Note 5: Mortgage
Banking Activities."

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED

     On January 1, 2001, we recorded a transition adjustment representing a $0.6
million loss ($0.4 million net of tax) related to the implementation of SFAS No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This loss
will be reflected in our earnings for the first quarter of 2001. This loss
represents the excess of book value over the remaining fair value of certain
interest rate cap agreements designated as cash flow hedges and the difference
between book value and fair value of forward loan sale contracts for which hedge
accounting was not elected. These losses were partially offset by unrealized
gains representing the fair value of commitments to originate loans that will be
held for sale when originated. We consider these commitments to be derivatives
and are therefore carried at market value.

     The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001 also resulted in an $11
million decrease ($7 million net of tax) in other comprehensive income. This
decrease represents $43 million ($27 million net of tax) in unrealized losses on
interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements designated as
cash flow hedges. This was partially offset by the net unrealized gain of $32
million ($20 million net of tax) that resulted from the reclassification of our
entire held-to-maturity MBS and investment portfolios of $16.57 billion to
available for sale upon adopting SFAS No. 133.

     In conjunction with the reclassification of our held-to-maturity MBS
portfolio to available for sale, $126 million was allocated to MSR, representing
retained interests from securitizations of loans that we had completed after
January 1, 1996 and for which no MSR had been previously capitalized. MSR are
capitalized for all securitizations of loans occurring after January 1, 1996
that are either sold or retained in the available-for-sale securities portfolio.

     The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001 also resulted in a $151
million increase in derivative-related assets, a $129 million increase in the
book values of hedged borrowings, and a $66 million increase in
derivative-related liabilities. Management does not anticipate that SFAS No. 133
will significantly increase the volatility of earnings or stockholders' equity
reported in future periods.

TAX CONTINGENCY

     From 1981 through 1985, Ahmanson acquired thrift institutions in six states
through Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation ("FSLIC")-assisted
transactions. The position was that assistance received from the FSLIC included
out-of-state branching rights valued at approximately $740 million. Prior to
December 31, 1998, Ahmanson had sold its deposit-taking businesses and abandoned
such branching rights in five states, the first of which was Missouri in 1993.
Our financial statements do not contain any benefit related to our determination
that we are entitled to a deduction for the amount of our tax bases in certain
state branching rights when we sold our deposit-taking businesses in those
states, thereby abandoning such branching rights. Our position is that the tax
bases result from the tax treatment of property received as assistance from the
FSLIC in conjunction with FSLIC-assisted transactions. The potential tax benefit
related to these abandonments as of December 31, 2000 could approach $238
million.

     The Internal Revenue Service has completed its examination of the Ahmanson
federal income tax returns for the years 1990 through 1993. The return for 1993
included the proposed adjustment related to the abandonment of the Missouri
branching rights. The matter is currently before the Appeals Branch of the
Service. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we do not
believe it is appropriate at this time to reflect any tax benefits in our
financial statements.

GOODWILL LITIGATION

     On August 9, 1989, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and
Enforcement Act ("FIRREA") was enacted. Among other things, FIRREA raised the
minimum capital requirements for savings institutions and required a phase-out
of the amount of supervisory goodwill that could be included in satisfying
certain regulatory capital requirements. The exclusion of supervisory goodwill
from regulatory capital led many savings institutions to either replace the lost
capital by issuing new qualifying debt or equity securities or to reduce assets.

     To date, trials have been concluded and opinions have been issued in a
number of actions in the United States Court of Federal Claims (the "Court") in
which savings institutions and investors in savings institutions sought damages
from the U.S. Government based on breach of contract and other theories.
Generally, in cases in which these opinions on the merits have been issued by
the Court, either the plaintiff(s), the defendant (U.S. Government), or both the
plaintiff(s) and the defendant, have opted to appeal the Court's decision. Such
appeals are now pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit (the "Federal Circuit").

  Home Savings

     In September 1992, Home Savings filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Government
in the Court for unspecified damages involving supervisory goodwill related to
its acquisitions of troubled savings institutions from 1981 to 1988.

     In March 1998, the U.S. Government conceded, while reserving the right to
contest certain issues on appeal, that Home Savings had entered into certain
contracts with the U.S. Government and that the U.S. Government took actions
that were inconsistent with those contracts. These contracts relate to Home
Savings' purchase of troubled savings institutions in Florida, Missouri, Texas
and Illinois and the purchase of Century Federal Savings of New York, with
associated unamortized supervisory goodwill of $426 million as of August 31,
1989.

     The U.S. Government has denied the existence of a contract and actions
inconsistent with such a contract in connection with Home Savings' purchase of
savings institutions in Ohio with unamortized supervisory goodwill of
approximately $34 million as of August 31, 1989. Home Savings had also pursued
legal remedies against the U.S. Government for the loss of supervisory goodwill
related to Home Savings' 1988 acquisition of The Bowery Savings Bank of New
York. On November 3, 1999, WMBFA (as successor to Home Savings) notified the
Court that WMBFA would not continue to pursue remedies in connection with The
Bowery Savings Bank of New York acquisition. Unamortized supervisory goodwill
from acquisitions that remain subjects of the lawsuit totaled approximately $460
million as of August 31, 1989.

     The U.S. Government has not conceded that Home Savings was damaged by any
breaches of contract addressed by the lawsuit, and as yet, there has been no
determination as to the amount of any damages that Home Savings may have
sustained as a result of any breach of contract. WMBFA (as successor to Home
Savings) continues to pursue a favorable outcome of this lawsuit.

  American Savings Bank, F.A.

     In December 1992, ASB, Keystone Holdings and certain related parties
brought a lawsuit against the United States, alleging, among other things, that
in connection with the acquisition of ASB they entered into a contract with
agencies of the United States and that the U.S. Government breached that
contract. As a result of the Keystone Transaction, we succeeded to all of the
rights of ASB, Keystone Holdings and such related parties in such litigation and
will receive any recovery from the litigation. ASB is now WMBFA.

     In connection with the Keystone Transaction, we delivered a specified
number of shares of our common stock into an escrow. There are currently 12
million shares in the escrow (the "Escrow Shares"). Upon our receipt of net cash
proceeds from a judgment in or settlement of the litigation, all or part of the
Escrow Shares will be released, 64.9% to investors in Keystone Holdings or their
assigns, and 35.1% to the FSLIC Resolution Fund or its assigns. The number of
Escrow Shares to be released will be equal to the case proceeds, reduced by
certain tax and litigation-related costs and expenses, divided by $27.7417. The
escrow will expire on

                                        48
<PAGE>   51

December 20, 2002, subject to extensions in certain circumstances. If not all
Escrow Shares are released prior to such expiration, any remaining Escrow Shares
will be returned to us for cancellation.

     The allegations made in the ASB case are similar to those asserted in other
cases where the United States Supreme Court affirmed decisions holding the U.S.
Government liable for breach of contract. However, no record has been
established in these other cases which would indicate what, if any, damages we
are entitled to receive in this case. Accordingly, the ultimate outcome of the
ASB case is uncertain, and there can be no assurance that we will benefit
financially from it. Generally, we expect to receive financial benefit only if
the cash proceeds, after reduction for certain tax and litigation-related costs
and expenses, exceed $333 million.

  Coast and Bank United Corp.

     Prior to their acquisitions, Coast and Bank United Corp. had similar
lawsuits against the U.S. Government. Generally, securities representing
interests in these lawsuits were issued to Coast and Bank United Corp.
shareholders. These securities, called contingent payment rights certificates,
are currently traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbols CCPRZ and
BNKUZ, respectively. We do not own a significant number of these securities.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. The
primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. The majority
of our interest rate risk arises from the instruments, positions and
transactions entered into for purposes other than trading. They include loans,
securities, deposits, borrowings, long-term debt and derivative financial
instruments used for asset/liability management. Interest rate risk occurs when
assets and liabilities reprice or mature at different times or frequencies as
market interest rates change.

     During the year, we implemented additional methodologies for analyzing
interest rate risk. These included projecting net interest income based on
parallel and non-parallel changes in the yield curve. The results of these
analyses are used as part of our overall framework for asset/liability
management. Accordingly, we have changed our market risk analysis from a tabular
presentation to a presentation of net interest income sensitivity.

     The table below indicates the sensitivity of pretax net interest income to
interest rate movements. The comparative scenarios assume that interest rates
rise or fall in even quarterly increments over the next twelve months for a
total increase or decrease of 200 basis points. The interest rate scenarios are
used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management's view
of future market movements.

     Our net interest income sensitivity profile as of year-end 2000 and 1999 is
stated below:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                                                              GRADUAL CHANGE IN RATES
                                                              ------------------------

                                                              --------        --------
<S>                                                           <C>             <C>
Net interest income change for the one-year period
  beginning:
  January 1, 2001...........................................     11.0%           (12.4)%
  January 1, 2000...........................................     11.3%           (11.6)%
</TABLE>

     Our net interest income at risk position has not changed significantly
year-over-year. Assumptions are made in modeling the sensitivity of net interest
income. The simulation model captures expected prepayment behavior under
changing interest rate environments. Additionally, the model captures the impact
of interest rate caps and floors on adjustable-rate products. Assumptions
regarding interest rate or balance behavior of non-maturity deposits reflect
management's best estimate of future behavior. Sensitivity of new loan volume to
market interest rate levels is included as well.

     We analyze additional interest rate scenarios, including more extreme
rising and falling rate environments to support interest rate risk management.
These additional scenarios also address the risk exposure in time periods beyond
the twelve months captured in this net interest income sensitivity analysis.

  Management of Interest Rate Risk and Derivative Activities

     To mitigate interest rate risk, we use derivative instruments, such as
interest rate exchange agreements and interest rate cap agreements. At December
31, 2000, we had entered into interest rate exchange agreements and interest
rate cap agreements with notional values of $22.18 billion. Additionally, $13.20
billion of interest rate floors and $751 million of interest rate caps have been
embedded within certain borrowings as of December 31, 2000. The majority of
these derivative contracts embedded within the borrowings will not become
effective until the first quarter of 2001 and beyond. Derivative instruments, if
not used appropriately, can subject a company to unintended financial exposure.
These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess
of the amount recognized in the Statement of Financial Condition. The contract
or notional amount of these instruments reflects the extent of involvement we
have in particular classes of financial instruments.

     Management, in conjunction with the Board of Directors, has established
strict policies and guidelines for the use of derivative instruments. These
instruments are not intended to be used as techniques to generate earnings by
speculating on the movements of interest rates, nor do we act as a dealer of
these instruments. See "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Note 20:
Interest Rate Risk Management."

     Our strategy is to use derivative instruments to hedge the repricing risk
associated with deposits and borrowings. For example, we have entered into
interest rate cap agreements to provide an additional layer of protection should
interest rates on deposits and borrowings rise. Through the use of these
agreements, management attempts to offset increases in interest expense related
to these deposits and borrowings and effectively lengthen the repricing period.
Thus, we have a degree of interest rate protection when interest rates increase
because the interest rate cap agreements provide a mechanism for repricing the
deposits and borrowings generally on pace with current market rates. There can
be no assurance that interest rate exchange agreements and interest rate cap
agreements will provide us with protection in all scenarios or to the full
extent of our exposure.

     During 2000, we entered into borrowing arrangements which contain embedded
derivative instruments. These instruments included caps and floors. Interest
rate floors are intended to hedge prepayment risk associated with our loans, MBS
and MSR. With interest rate floors, we will receive cash flows when the interest
rate index drops below certain levels (strike rate). The amount of the cash
flows are calculated based on the difference between the strike rate and the
index rate multiplied by the notional amount. Similarly, the interest rate caps
provide us cash flows when the interest rate index exceeds the strike rate.
Interest rate caps are intended to hedge repricing of liabilities and securities
that are purchased to hedge MSR.

     We also hedge the risks associated with the mortgage pipeline. The mortgage
pipeline consists of fixed-and adjustable-rate SFR loans which will be sold in
the secondary market. The risk with the mortgage pipeline is that interest rates
might rise between the time the customer locks in the interest rate on the loan
and the time the loan is sold. This period is usually 30 to 60 days. To hedge
this risk, we execute forward sales agreements and option contracts. A forward
sales agreement protects us in a rising interest rate environment since the
sales price and delivery date have already been established. A forward sales
agreement, however, is different from an option contract in that we are
obligated to deliver the loan to the third party on the agreed upon future date.
As a result, if the loans do not fund, we may not have the necessary assets to
meet our commitment. Therefore, we would be required to purchase other assets,
at current market prices, to satisfy the forward sales agreement. To mitigate
this risk, we use fallout factors, which represent the percentage of loans which
are not expected to close, when calculating the amount of forward sales
agreements to execute.

  Counterparty Risk

     Our borrowing activities (including repurchase agreements) and derivative
instruments generally involve an exchange of obligations with another financial
institution, referred to in such transactions as a "counterparty." If a
counterparty were to default, we could be exposed to a financial loss. A loss
would result to the extent that the value of the collateral or funds held by the
counterparty exceeded the value of the collateral or funds held by us. In order
to minimize the risk, all counterparties are evaluated for financial strength on
at least an annual basis. Exposure limits are then established for each
counterparty. Our primary focus is to deal with well-established, reputable and
financially strong firms.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Washington Mutual, Inc.:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial
condition of Washington Mutual, Inc. and subsidiaries ("the Company") as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and of cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial condition of Washington Mutual, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  Basis of Presentation

     Washington Mutual, Inc. ("WMI" and together with its subsidiaries,
"Washington Mutual" or the "Company") is a financial services company committed
to serving consumers and small to mid-sized businesses. Through its
subsidiaries, Washington Mutual engages in the following lines of business:
consumer banking, mortgage banking, commercial banking, financial services and
consumer finance. The Company's principal banking subsidiaries are Washington
Mutual Bank, FA ("WMBFA"), Washington Mutual Bank ("WMB") and Washington Mutual
Bank fsb ("WMBfsb"). The banking subsidiaries accept deposits from the general
public, make, buy and sell residential loans, consumer loans, and commercial
loans, and engage in certain commercial banking activities. The Company
originates, purchases, sells and services specialty mortgage finance loans
through its subsidiaries, Washington Mutual Finance Corporation ("Washington
Mutual Finance") and Long Beach Mortgage Company ("Long Beach Mortgage"). In
addition, WMBFA purchases specialty mortgage finance loans. Through licensed
subsidiaries, Washington Mutual also markets annuities and other insurance
products, offers full service securities brokerage operations, and acts as the
investment advisor to and the distributor of mutual funds.

     The Company has a concentration of operations in California. At December
31, 2000, 52% of the Company's loan portfolio and 71% of the Company's deposits
were concentrated in California.

     Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1999 and 1998 financial
statements to conform to the 2000 presentation. All intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated.

     On October 1, 1998, H.F. Ahmanson & Company ("Ahmanson") merged with and
into WMI and all of the subsidiaries of Ahmanson, including Home Savings of
America, FSB ("Home Savings"), became subsidiaries of the Company (the "Ahmanson
Merger"). The Ahmanson Merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests. When
Washington Mutual acquires a company through a pooling of interests, current and
prior period financial statements are restated to include the accounts of merged
companies. As a result, the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto
are presented as if the companies were merged as of the beginning of the
earliest period shown. Previously reported balances of the merged companies have
been reclassified to conform to the Company's presentation and restated to give
effect to the combinations.

     On February 13, 1998, Ahmanson had acquired Coast Savings Financial, Inc.
("Coast"). On October 1, 1999, Washington Mutual acquired Long Beach Financial
Corporation, parent of Long Beach Mortgage. Both acquisitions were accounted for
as purchases.

  Use of Estimates

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents

     For the purpose of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
cash on hand, amounts due from banks, U.S. Treasury bills, overnight
investments, commercial paper and repurchase agreements with an initial maturity
of three months or less.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

  Held-to-Maturity Securities

     Investments classified as held to maturity are accounted for at amortized
cost because the Company has both the positive intent and the ability to hold
those securities to maturity. Other than temporary declines in fair value are
recognized in the income statement as loss from securities.

  Available-for-Sale Securities

     Securities not classified as held to maturity are considered to be
available for sale. Gains and losses realized on the sale of these securities
are based on the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses
from available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported (net
of tax) in accumulated other comprehensive income until realized. Other than
temporary declines in fair value are recognized in the income statement as loss
from securities.

  Loans Held for Sale

     Loans held for sale include originated and purchased mortgage loans
intended for sale in the secondary market. The loans so designated are carried
at the lower of net cost or fair value on an aggregate basis.

  Loans Held in Portfolio

     Loans held in portfolio are recorded at the principal amount outstanding,
net of deferred loan costs or fees and any discounts or premiums on purchased
loans. Deferred costs or fees, discounts and premiums are amortized using the
interest method over the contractual term of the loan adjusted for actual
prepayments.

     Management generally ceases to accrue interest income on all loans that
become four payments delinquent and reverses all interest accrued up to that
time. Thereafter, interest income is accrued only if and when, in management's
opinion, projected cash proceeds are deemed sufficient to repay both principal
and interest. All loans for which interest is not being accrued are referred to
as loans on nonaccrual status.

     Commercial real estate loans over $1 million, and all commercial business
and builder construction loans are individually evaluated for impairment.
Management generally identifies loans to be evaluated for impairment when such
loans are on nonaccrual status or have been restructured. However, not all
nonaccrual loans are impaired. Loans are considered impaired when it is probable
that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts contractually due,
including scheduled interest payments. Restructured loans are evaluated for
impairment based on the contractual terms specified by the original loan
agreement, rather than the contractual terms specified by the restructuring
agreement. Loans performing under restructured terms beyond a specified
performance period are classified as accruing, but may still be deemed impaired.
Factors involved in determining impairment include, but are not limited to, the
financial condition of the borrower, the value of the underlying collateral, and
current economic conditions. All other loans are reviewed on a collective basis.

  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses

     The allowance for loan and lease losses represents management's estimate of
credit losses inherent in the Company's loan and lease portfolios as of the
balance sheet date. Management performs periodic reviews of its portfolios to
identify these inherent losses, and to assess the overall probability of
collection of these portfolios. The process by which the allowance is determined
encompasses the analysis of the historical performance of each loan category and
an assessment of current economic and portfolio trends and conditions, as well
as specific risk factors impacting the loan and lease portfolios. The Company
monitors delinquency, default, and loss rates, among other factors impacting
portfolio risk. In addition, non-homogeneous type loans, such as commercial
business and commercial real estate loans, are reviewed on an individual loan
basis in order to identify impairment and for risk rating purposes.

                                        61

                    WASHINGTON MUTUAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     When available information confirms that specific loans or portions thereof
are uncollectible, these amounts are charged off against the allowance for loan
and lease losses. The existence of some or all of the following criteria will
generally confirm that a loss has been incurred: the loan is significantly
delinquent and the borrower has not evidenced the ability or intent to bring the
loan current; the Company has no recourse to the borrower, or if it does, the
borrower has insufficient assets to pay the debt; or the fair value of the loan
collateral is significantly below the current loan balance and there is little
or no near-term prospect for improvement.

     Consumer finance loans secured by collateral other than real estate are
charged off if and when they exceed a specified number of days contractually
delinquent (180 days for substantially all loans).

     The ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors
beyond the Company's control. These factors may result in losses or recoveries
differing significantly from those provided for in the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

  Allowance for Recourse Obligations

     The Company records an allowance for recourse obligations to cover inherent
losses on loans securitized and retained in its mortgage-backed securities
("MBS") portfolio for which the Company retains the credit risk and to cover
estimated losses on loans and MBS sold to third parties for which a recourse
obligation exists. A regular review is performed to determine the adequacy of
the allowance for recourse obligations. The review is substantially similar to
the review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses, because
the sold loans and securities, as to which a recourse obligation exists, are
similar to the Company's single-family residential ("SFR") loan portfolio.
Increases to the allowance for recourse obligations are recorded as loss from
securities.

  Foreclosed Assets

     Foreclosed assets include properties acquired through foreclosure that are
transferred at fair value, less estimated selling costs, which represents the
new recorded basis of the property. Subsequently, properties are evaluated and
any additional declines in value are recorded in current period earnings. The
amount the Company ultimately recovers from foreclosed assets may differ
substantially from the net carrying value of these assets because of future
market factors beyond the Company's control or because of changes in the
Company's strategy for sale or development of the property.

  Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets

     SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities, was issued in September 2000 and replaces
SFAS No. 125 of the same title. This statement revises the standards for
accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and
collateral and requires certain disclosures, but carries over most of SFAS No.
125's provisions without reconsideration. This statement is effective for
transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities
occurring after March 31, 2001 and is effective for recognition and
reclassification of collateral and for disclosures relating to securitization
transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2000. The
adoption of this statement by the Company is not expected to materially affect
the results of operations or financial condition of the Company. See "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements -- Note 3: Securities and Note 5: Mortgage
Banking Activities."

     In connection with securitizations or transfers, certain retained
interests, including MSR, are recorded at their allocated carrying value based
on their relative fair value. Initially and at subsequent measurement dates,
fair value is determined by computing the present value of the estimated cash
flows retained, using the dates that such cash flows are expected to be released
to the Company, at a discount rate considered to be

                                        62
<PAGE>   65
                    WASHINGTON MUTUAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

commensurate with the risks associated with the cash flows. The amounts and
timing of the cash flows are estimated after considering various economic
factors including prepayment, delinquency, default and loss assumptions.
Valuation of retained interests in securitizations may also involve the use of
quoted market prices on same or similar securities.

     MSR are capitalized at their allocated carrying value and amortized in
proportion to, and over the period of, estimated future net servicing income.

     The Company assesses impairment of the MSR based on the fair value of those
rights on a stratum-by-stratum basis, with any impairment recognized through a
valuation allowance for each impaired stratum. For purposes of measuring
impairment, the MSR are stratified based on the following characteristics of the
underlying loans: fixed-rate mortgage loans by loan type (conforming,
nonconforming, and government) and by coupon rate (less than 7.5%, between 7.5%
and less than 9.0%, and greater than or equal to 9.0%) and adjustable-rate
mortgage ("ARM") loans. The Company changed the stratification used for
impairment review in the fourth quarter of 2000 and such change did not have a
material effect on the financial statements.

     In order to determine the fair value of the MSR, the Company uses a model
that estimates the present value of expected future cash flows. Assumptions used
in the model include market discount rates and anticipated prepayment speeds.
The prepayment speeds are determined in relation to forecasted yield curves of
selected government securities. In addition, the Company uses market comparables
for estimates of the cost of servicing per loan, inflation rates, ancillary
income per loan and default rates.

  Premises and Equipment

     Land, buildings, leasehold improvements and equipment are carried at
amortized cost. Buildings and equipment are depreciated over their estimated
useful lives using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the shorter of their useful lives or lease terms. The Company
reviews buildings, leasehold improvements, and equipment for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. Impairment exists when the estimated undiscounted cash
flows for the property is less than its carrying value. If identified, an
impairment loss is recognized through a charge to earnings based on the fair
value of the property.

  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

     Goodwill and other intangible assets represent the excess of purchase price
over the fair value of net assets acquired by the Company. The excess cost over
fair value of net assets acquired consists of goodwill, core deposit premiums,
and other intangible assets. Substantially all of the Company's goodwill is
being amortized using the straight-line method over 10 to 25 years. Other
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company
reviews its intangible assets periodically for other-than-temporary impairment.
If such impairment is indicated, recoverability of the asset is assessed based
on expected undiscounted net cash flows.

  Repurchase Agreements

     The Company enters into agreements under which it sells securities subject
to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities. Under these
arrangements, the Company transfers legal control over the assets but still
retains effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obligates
the Company to repurchase the assets. As a result, repurchase agreements are
accounted for as financing arrangements and not as a sale and subsequent
repurchase of securities. The obligation to repurchase the securities is
reflected as a liability in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition
while the dollar amount of securities underlying the agreements remains in the
respective asset accounts. These securities are classified as encumbered.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

  Income Taxes

     Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under
this method, a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the
enacted tax rates which will be in effect when the differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and
liabilities are expected to be reported in the Company's income tax returns. The
comprehensive deferred tax provision for the year is equal to the change in the
deferred tax asset from the beginning to the end of the year. The effect on
deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date of the change.

     The Company reports income and expenses using the accrual method of
accounting and files a consolidated tax return on that basis as well. The
Company's federal tax filings generally include all subsidiaries.

  Earnings Per Share

     Earnings per share ("EPS") are presented under two formats: basic EPS and
diluted EPS. EPS is computed by dividing net income (after deducting dividends
on preferred stock) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the year. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income (after deducting
dividends on preferred stock) by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the year, plus the impact of dilutive potential common
shares, such as stock options.

  Derivative Instruments

     The Company uses derivative instruments, such as interest rate exchange
agreements, interest rate cap agreements, and forward sales contracts of
financial instruments to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk. All of the
Company's derivative instruments are used for purposes other than trading.
Interest rate exchange agreements and interest rate cap agreements are used only
if they have the effect of changing the interest rate characteristics of the
assets or liabilities to which they are designated. Such effect is measured
through ongoing correlation or effectiveness tests.

     Interest rate exchange agreements and interest rate cap agreements are
designated against interest-earning assets, deposits and borrowings. Interest
rate exchange agreements and interest rate cap agreements designated against
deposits and borrowings are reported at historical cost.

     The interest differential paid or received on interest rate exchange
agreements and interest rate cap agreements is recorded as an adjustment to
interest income or interest expense. The purchase premium of interest rate cap
agreements is capitalized and amortized as a component of interest income or
interest expense over the original term of the interest rate cap agreement. No
purchase premiums are paid at the time of entering into interest rate exchange
agreements.

     From time to time, the Company terminates interest rate exchange agreements
and interest rate cap agreements prior to maturity. Such circumstances arise if,
in the judgment of management, such instruments no longer effectively meet
policy objectives.

     Usually such instruments are within one year of maturity. Gains and losses
from terminated interest rate exchange agreements and interest rate cap
agreements are recognized, consistent with the gain or loss on the asset or
liability associated with the agreement. When the asset or liability is not sold
or paid off, the gains or losses are deferred and amortized as additional
interest income or interest expense over the original terms of the agreements or
the remaining life of the designated asset or liability, whichever is less.

     From time to time, the Company redesignates interest rate exchange
agreements and interest rate cap agreements between interest-earning assets and
deposits and borrowings. Such redesignations are recorded at fair value at the
time of transfer.

                                        64
<PAGE>   67
                    WASHINGTON MUTUAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     The Company may write covered call options on its available-for-sale
portfolio. If the option is exercised, the option fee is recorded as an
adjustment to the gain or loss on the sale of the security. If the option is not
exercised, the option fee is recognized as fee income.

  Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

     On January 1, 2001, the Company recorded a transition adjustment
representing a $0.6 million loss ($0.4 million net of tax) related to the
implementation of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities. This loss will be reflected in the Company's earnings for
the first quarter of 2001. This loss represents the excess of book value over
the remaining fair value of certain interest rate cap agreements designated as
cash flow hedges and the difference between book value and fair value of forward
loan sale contracts for which hedge accounting was not elected. These losses
were partially offset by unrealized gains representing the fair value of
commitments to originate loans that will be held for sale when originated. The
Company considers these commitments to be derivatives and are therefore carried
at market value.

     The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001 also resulted in an $11
million decrease ($7 million net of tax) in other comprehensive income. This
decrease represents $43 million ($27 million net of tax) in unrealized losses on
interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements designated as
cash flow hedges. This was partially offset by the net unrealized gain of $32
million ($20 million net of tax) that resulted from the reclassification of the
Company's entire held-to-maturity MBS and investment portfolios of $16.57
billion to available for sale upon adopting SFAS No. 133.

     In conjunction with the reclassification of the Company's held-to-maturity
MBS portfolio to available for sale, $126 million was allocated to MSR,
representing retained interests from securitizations of loans that the Company
had completed after January 1, 1996 and for which no MSR had been previously
capitalized. MSR are capitalized for all securitizations of loans occurring
after January 1, 1996 that are either sold or retained in the available-for-sale
securities portfolio.

     The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001 also resulted in a $151
million increase in derivative-related assets, a $129 million increase in the
book values of hedged borrowings, and a $66 million increase in
derivative-related liabilities. Management does not anticipate that SFAS No. 133
will significantly increase the volatility of earnings or stockholders' equity
reported in future periods.

NOTE 2: BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

     On January 31, 2001, Washington Mutual, Inc. acquired the mortgage
operations of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. The principal subsidiaries
acquired in that transaction were renamed Washington Mutual Home Loans, Inc.
("WMHLI") and Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp. ("WMMSC"). At January
31, 2001, WMHLI and WMMSC had total assets of approximately $7 billion.

     On February 9, 2001, Washington Mutual, Inc. acquired Texas-based Bank
United Corp. This acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. At February 9,
2001, Bank United Corp. had total assets of approximately $18 billion. The
Company issued approximately 42,600,000 shares of its common stock to acquire
Bank United Corp. Each share of Bank United Corp. common stock was converted
into 1.3 shares of Washington Mutual, Inc. common stock.

NOTE 5: MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES

     During 2000, the Company sold residential mortgage loans in securitization
transactions and retained servicing responsibilities and subordinated interests.
The Company receives annual servicing fees equal to a percentage of the
outstanding balance and rights to cash flows remaining after the investors in
the securitization trust have received their contractual payments. The book
balance of loans securitized and sold during the year ended December 31, 2000
was $16.90 billion. Of those loans, $812 million are held by investors and
securitization trusts that have recourse to the Company. The Company recognized
pretax gains of $189 million on these securitizations. The Company's retained
interests are subordinate to investors' interests.

     Key economic assumptions used in measuring the value of all the retained
interests accounted for as sales (excluding MSR) at the date of securitization
during the year were as follows (rates per annum and weighted based on principal
amounts securitized):

     These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As
the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on a variation in assumptions
generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in
assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table,
the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the
retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption; in
reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example,
increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments and increased
credit losses), which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.

     Static pool losses are calculated by summing the actual and projected
future credit losses and dividing them by the original balance of each pool of
assets. As of December 31, 2000, static pool losses for all Adjustable
Non-Government Sponsored Enterprise assets and Specialty Mortgage Finance assets
that were valued using specific credit loss assumptions were not material.

NOTE 10: ADVANCES FROM FHLBS

     As members of the FHLBs of San Francisco and Seattle, WMBFA, WMB, and
WMBfsb maintain credit lines that are percentages of their total regulatory
assets, subject to collateralization requirements. Advances are collateralized
in the aggregate by all stock owned of the FHLBs, by deposits with the FHLBs,
and by certain mortgages or deeds of trust and securities of the U.S. Government
and its agencies. The maximum amount of credit, which the FHLBs will extend for
purposes other than meeting withdrawals, varies from time to time in accordance
with their policies. The interest rates charged by the FHLBs for advances vary
depending upon maturity, the cost of funds in the individual FHLB and the
purpose of the borrowing.

     Scheduled maturities of advances from FHLBs were as follows:

     At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company had unused lines of credit
totaling $243 million and $793 million with the Federal Reserve Bank discount
window.

     At December 31, 2000, the Company had two revolving credit facilities with
The Chase Manhattan Bank as administrative agent: a $1.20 billion 364-day
facility and a $600 million four-year facility, which provide back-up for the
Company's commercial paper programs. At December 31, 2000, the Company had $841
million available under these facilities, which represents the total amount of
the two revolving credit facilities, net of the amount of commercial paper
outstanding at year-end.

     As of December 31, 2000, the Company had entered into eight letters of
credit with the FHLBs of San Francisco and Seattle, for a total of $248 million.
These letters of credit provide credit enhancement on housing revenue bonds and
certain of the Company's private issue MBS.

     Provisions of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (the "Job
Protection Act") significantly altered the Company's tax bad debt deduction
method and the circumstances that would require a tax bad debt reserve
recapture. Prior to enactment of the Job Protection Act, savings institutions
were permitted to compute their tax bad debt deduction through use of either the
reserve method or the percentage of taxable income method. The Job Protection
Act repealed both of these methods for large savings institutions and allows bad
debt deductions based only on actual current losses. While repealing the reserve
method for computing tax bad debt deductions, the Job Protection Act allows
thrifts to retain their existing base year bad debt reserves but requires that
reserves in excess of the balance at December 31, 1987 be recaptured into
taxable income. The tax liability for this recapture is included in the
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

     The base year reserve is recaptured into taxable income only in limited
situations, such as in the event of certain excess distributions or complete
liquidation. None of the limited circumstances requiring recapture are
contemplated by the Company. The amount of the Company's tax bad debt reserves
subject to recapture in these circumstances approximates $2.01 billion at
December 31, 2000. Due to the remote nature of events that may trigger the
recapture provisions, no tax liability has been established in the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements.

     During 1998, the Company completed a settlement with the Internal Revenue
Service (the "Service") for Great Western for 1987 and 1986, and Washington
Mutual for 1993 and 1992. During 1999, the Service completed its examination of
Great Western for 1988 through 1992. The case has been referred to the Appeals
Branch for review.

     The Service is currently examining Ahmanson for 1994 through September
1998, Washington Mutual for 1994 through 1997, and Great Western for 1993
through 1997. The Service has completed its examination of Ahmanson for 1990
through 1993. All issues have been resolved except for one, which is under
review by the Appeals Branch. The Service's National Office has issued an
adverse ruling on this issue. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any
benefit with respect to this issue.

     As of December 31, 2000, the Company's accrual for income taxes payable is
sufficient to cover any expected liabilities arising from these examinations.

</TABLE>

     The Company establishes a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of
available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax asset will not be realized. The valuation allowance of $164 million
at December 31, 2000 and $239 million at December 31, 1999 relate primarily to
net operating losses that are limited by Internal Revenue Code Section 382 as a
result of the acquisition of Keystone Holdings, Inc. (the "Keystone
Transaction").

     As a result of the Keystone Transaction, the Company and certain of its
affiliates are parties to an agreement (the "Assistance Agreement") with a
predecessor of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation ("FSLIC")
Resolution Fund (the "FRF"), which generally provides that 75% of most of the
federal tax savings and approximately 19.5% of most of the California tax
savings (as computed in accordance with the Assistance Agreement), attributable
to the Company's utilization of certain tax loss carryovers of New West Federal
Savings and Loan Association, are to be paid by the Company to the FRF. These
amounts are considered payments in lieu. The Assistance Agreement sets forth
certain special adjustments to federal taxable income to arrive at "FSLIC
taxable income," which is then offset by utilizable net operating losses to
compute the benefit due to the FRF.

NOTE 13: CONTINGENCIES

     The Company has certain litigation and negotiations in progress resulting
from activities arising from normal operations. In the opinion of management,
none of these matters is likely to have a materially adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations or financial condition.

     As part of the administration and oversight of the Assistance Agreement and
other agreements among American Savings Bank, F.A. ("ASB"), certain of its
affiliates and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), the FDIC has
a variety of review and audit rights, including the right to review and audit
computations of payments in lieu of taxes.

     In order to meet the needs of its customers, Washington Mutual issues
direct-pay, standby and other letters of credit. The credit risk in issuing
letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan
facilities to customers. Washington Mutual holds collateral to support letters
of credit when deemed necessary. At December 31, 2000, outstanding letters of
credit issued by Washington Mutual totaled $327 million.

     The Company is a party to goodwill litigation that may result in a gain.
The ultimate outcome is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the Company
will benefit financially from it.

(1) These dividends have not been restated to reflect pooling combinations.

     Prior to their business combination with Washington Mutual, acquired
companies paid total common cash dividends of $70 million in 1998. No common
cash dividends were paid by acquired companies in 1999 or 2000.

     In addition to being influenced by legal, regulatory and economic
restrictions, WMI's ability to pay dividends is also predicated on the ability
of its subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends to WMI. These subsidiaries are
subject to legal, regulatory and debt covenant restrictions on their ability to
pay dividends.

     In October 2000, the 1994 Shareholder Rights Plan expired in accordance
with its terms. On December 19, 2000, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a
new Shareholder Rights Plan and declared a dividend of one right for each
outstanding share of common stock to shareholders of record on January 4, 2001.
The rights have certain anti-takeover effects. They are intended to discourage
coercive or unfair takeover tactics and to encourage any potential acquirer to
negotiate a price fair to all shareholders. The rights may cause substantial
dilution to an acquiring party that attempts to acquire the Company on terms not
approved by the Board of Directors, but they will not interfere with any
friendly merger or other business combination. The plan was not adopted in
response to any specific effort to acquire control of the Company.

  Preferred Stock

     There was no preferred stock (10,000,000 shares authorized) issued or
outstanding at December 31, 2000 and 1999. The preferred stock previously
outstanding was redeemed in 1998.

     Options to purchase an average of 7,182,297 shares of common stock at an
average exercise price of $36.21 per share were outstanding during the year, but
were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the exercise price
of the options was greater than the average market price of the common stock
during the year.

     Additionally, as part of the business combination with Keystone Holdings,
Inc. (the parent of ASB) 12 million shares of common stock, with an assigned
value of $27.74 per share, were issued to an escrow for the benefit of the
general and limited partners of Keystone Holdings, Inc. and the FRF and their
transferees. The conditions upon which these shares are contingently issuable
are based on the outcome of certain litigation and not based on earnings or
market price. At December 31, 2000, the contingencies were not met, and
therefore, the contingently issuable shares were not included in the above
computations.

     On February 9, 2001, Washington Mutual, Inc. issued approximately
42,600,000 shares of common stock for the acquisition of Bank United Corp.

NOTE 17: REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

     WMI is not subject to regulatory capital requirements. However, each of its
subsidiary depository institutions is subject to various regulatory capital
requirements. WMB is subject to FDIC capital requirements while WMBFA and WMBfsb
are subject to Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS") capital requirements.

     The capital adequacy requirements are quantitative measures established by
regulation that require WMBFA, WMB and WMBfsb to maintain minimum amounts and
ratios of capital. The FDIC requires WMB to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1
and total capital to risk-weighted assets as well as Tier 1 capital to average
assets. The OTS requires WMBFA and WMBfsb to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1
and total capital to risk-weighted assets, as well as Tier 1 capital to adjusted
total assets.

     The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
("FDICIA") created a statutory framework that increased the importance of
meeting applicable capital requirements. FDICIA established five capital
categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized,
significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institution's
category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant
capital measures, which include a risk-based capital measure, a leverage ratio
capital measure, and certain other factors. The federal banking agencies
(including the FDIC and the OTS) have adopted regulations that implement this
statutory framework. Under these regulations, an institution is treated as well
capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is 10.00% or
more, its ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is 6.00% or more, its
leverage capital ratio is 5.00% or more and it is not subject to any federal
supervisory order or directive to meet a specific capital level.

     Under these same regulations, an institution is treated as adequately
capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is 8.00% or
more, its ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is 4.00% or more, its
leverage capital ratio is 4.00% or more, and it is not subject to any federal
supervisory order or directive to meet a specific capital level.

     Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective
action requirements, regulatory controls and restrictions, which become more
extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized. Failure by
any of the Company's depository institutions to comply with applicable capital
requirements would, if unremedied, result in restrictions on its activities and
lead to regulatory enforcement actions against such institutions including, but
not limited to, the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of
required capital levels. FDICIA requires the federal banking regulators to take
prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not
meet minimum capital requirements. Additionally, FDIC or OTS approval of any
regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance
with capital requirements.

(1) The minimum leverage ratio guideline is 3% for financial institutions that
    do not anticipate significant growth and that have well-diversified risk,
    excellent asset quality, high liquidity, good earnings, effective management
    and monitoring of market risk and, in general, are considered top-rate,
    strong banking organizations.

     Management believes that WMBFA, WMB and WMBfsb individually met all capital
adequacy requirements, as of December 31, 2000, to which they were subject.
Additionally, as of the most recent notifications from the FDIC (for WMB) and
the OTS (for WMBFA and WMBfsb), the FDIC and OTS individually categorized WMBFA,
WMB and WMBfsb as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt
corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, a bank must maintain
minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 or leverage capital
ratios as set forth in the table above. There are no conditions or events since
those notifications that management believes have changed the well capitalized
status of WMBFA, WMB and WMBfsb.

     Federal law requires that the federal banking agencies' risk-based capital
guidelines take into account various factors including interest rate risk,
concentration of credit risk, risks associated with nontraditional activities,
and the actual performance and expected risk of loss of multi-family mortgages.
In 1994, the federal banking agencies jointly revised their capital standards to
specify that concentration of credit and nontraditional activities are among the
factors that the agencies will consider in evaluating capital adequacy. In that
year, the OTS and FDIC amended their risk-based capital standards with respect
to the risk weighting of loans made to finance the purchase or construction of
multi-family residences. The OTS adopted final regulations adding an interest
rate risk component to the risk-based capital requirements for savings
associations (such as WMBFA and WMBfsb), although implementation of the
regulation has been delayed. Management believes that the effect of including
such an interest rate risk component in the calculation of risk-adjusted capital
would not cause WMBFA or WMBfsb to cease to be well capitalized. In June 1996,
the FDIC and certain other federal banking agencies (not including the OTS)
issued a joint policy statement providing guidance on prudent interest rate risk
management principles. The agencies stated that they would

determine banks' interest rate risk on a case-by-case basis, and would not adopt
a standardized measure or establish an explicit minimum capital charge for
interest rate risk.

NOTE 18: STOCK OPTION PLANS, EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN, AND RESTRICTED STOCK
PLANS

     On March 8, 1984, the Company's stockholders approved the adoption of the
1983 incentive stock option plan, providing for the award of incentive stock
options or nonqualified stock options to certain officers of the Company at the
discretion of the Board of Directors. On April 19, 1994, the Company's
stockholders approved the adoption of the 1994 stock option plan (the "1994
Plan") in which the right to purchase common stock of WMI may be granted to
officers, directors, consultants and advisers of the Company. The 1994 Plan is
generally similar to the 1983 plan, which terminated according to its terms in
1993. The 1994 Plan does not affect any options granted under the 1983 plan.

     Under the 1994 Plan, on the date of the grant, the exercise price of the
option must at least equal the market value per share of WMI's common stock. The
1994 Plan provides for the granting of options for a maximum of 30 million
common shares. During 2000, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the
maximum number of common shares available for grant from 18 million to 30
million.

     On September 16, 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved the
adoption of a broad-based stock option plan called "WAMU Shares" as part of the
Company's effort to build a unified team and to appropriately compensate its
employees. This plan provides for an award of nonqualified stock options to all
eligible employees who were employed by the Company on September 1, 1997.
Generally, full-time employees have an option to purchase 150 shares of WMI
common stock, while part-time employees have an option to purchase 75 shares.
Employees who were designated to receive options under the 1994 Plan were
excluded. All grants were made using the fair market value of WMI's common stock
on September 1, 1997, and all options vested on September 1, 1999. The WAMU
Shares plan provides for the granting of options for a maximum of 3,300,000
common shares.

     On December 15, 1998, the Company's Board of Directors approved the
adoption of a broad-based stock option plan ("WAMU Shares II") to provide a
performance incentive and encourage stock ownership by employees of the Company.
This plan provides for an award of nonqualified stock options to all eligible
employees who were employed by the Company on January 4, 1999. Full-time
employees received an option to purchase 100 shares of WMI common stock, while
part-time employees received an option to purchase 50 shares. Employees who were
designated to receive options under the 1994 Plan were excluded. These employee
stock options were in addition to the Company's previous broad-based stock
option plan described above. Options under the WAMU Shares II plan were granted
at the fair market value of WMI's common stock on December 14, 1998, and all
options vested on January 4, 2001. The WAMU Shares II plan provides for the
granting of options up to a maximum of 3,300,000 common shares.

     Stock options under all stock plans were generally exercisable on a
phased-in schedule over two to five years, depending upon the terms of the
grant, and expire three to ten years from the grant date. Options to purchase
10,045,033 and 9,128,792 shares of common stock were fully exercisable at
December 31, 2000 and 1999.

     Under the terms of the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"), an
employee may purchase WMI common stock at a 15% discount without paying
brokerage fees or commissions on purchases. The Company pays for the program's
administrative expenses. The plan is open to all employees who are at least 18
years old, have completed at least one year of service, and work at least 20
hours per week. Participation can be by either payroll deduction or lump sum
payments with a maximum annual contribution of 10% of each employee's previous
year's eligible cash compensation. Under the ESPP, dividends are automatically
reinvested.

     The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, and will
continue to measure its employee stock-based compensation arrangements under the
provisions of the AICPA Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25. Accordingly, no
compensation cost has been recognized for its stock option plans and its ESPP.

     The Company maintains a restricted stock plan for the benefit of directors,
key officers, loan officers and investment representatives. Under the plan, the
Company granted 684,490, 474,893 and 203,904 shares of restricted stock in 2000,
1999 and 1998. Upon grant, shares are issued to a trustee and are released to
recipients when the restrictions lapse. The restrictions are based upon either a
continuous service or performance requirement. At the date of grant, unearned
compensation is recorded as an offset to stockholders' equity and is amortized
as compensation expense over the restricted period. The balance of unearned
compensation related to these restricted shares as of December 31, 2000 was $23
million.

     The total compensation expense recognized for the restricted shares was $21
million, $9 million and $9 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998. Restricted shares
accrue dividends. All canceled or forfeited shares become available for future
grants.

  Pension Plan

     Washington Mutual maintains a noncontributory cash balance defined benefit
pension plan (the "Pension Plan") for substantially all eligible employees.
Benefits earned for each year of service are based primarily on the level of
compensation in that year plus a stipulated rate of return on the benefit
balance. It is the

  Nonqualified Defined Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

     The Company, as successor to previously acquired companies has assumed
responsibility for nonqualified, noncontributory unfunded postretirement benefit
plans, including retirement restoration plans for certain employees, a number of
supplemental retirement plans for certain officers, and multiple outside
directors' retirement plans. Benefits under the retirement restoration plans are
generally determined by the Company. Benefits under the supplemental retirement
plans are generally based on years of service. Benefits under the outside
directors' retirement plans generally are payable for a period equal to the
participants' service on the Board of Directors, with a lifetime benefit payable
to participants with 15 or more years of service.

     The Company, as successor to previously acquired companies maintains
unfunded defined benefit postretirement plans that make medical and life
insurance coverage available to eligible retired employees and dependents. The
expected cost of providing these benefits to retirees, their beneficiaries and
covered dependents was accrued during the years each employee provided services.

     For measurement of the net periodic cost of other postretirement benefit
plans, a 5.75% annual increase in the medical card trend rate was assumed for
2000 and thereafter. The assumed discount rate was 7.75% for 2000 and 1999, and
6.75% for 1998.

  Account Balance Plans

     Savings Plans. The Company sponsors a retirement savings and investment
plan (the "RSIP") for all eligible employees that allows participants to make
contributions by salary deduction equal to 15% or less of their salary pursuant
to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employee contributions vest
immediately. The Company's matching contributions and any profit sharing
contributions made to employees vest based on years of service.

     Company contributions to savings plans were $41 million, $39 million and
$36 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998.

     Other Account Balance Plans. The Company sponsors supplemental employee and
executive retirement plans for the benefit of certain officers. The plans are
designed to supplement the benefits that are accrued under the Pension Plans.

NOTE 20: INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

     From time to time, the following strategies may be used by the Company to
reduce its exposure to interest rate risk: the origination and purchase of ARMs
and the purchase of adjustable-rate MBS; the sale of fixed-rate SFR loan
production or fixed-rate MBS; and the use of derivative instruments, such as
interest rate exchange agreements, interest rate cap agreements, forward sales
contracts, interest rate floors, and purchased puts.

     The Company uses forward sales contracts to hedge its exposure to
increasing interest rates with respect to fixed-rate loans and loan commitments
which the Company intends to sell in the secondary market. Forward sales
contracts are used to sell fixed-rate loans at a future date for a specified
price. Gains or losses are recognized at the time the contracts mature and are
recorded as a component of gain on sale of loans. As of December 31, 2000 and
1999, the Company had $2.36 billion and $635 million in forward sales contracts
to hedge loan commitments, which were expected to close, and SFR loans, which
were held for sale.

     Interest rate exchange agreements, interest rate cap agreements, and
forward sales contracts expose the Company to credit risk in the event of
nonperformance by counterparties to such agreements. This risk consists
primarily of the termination value of agreements where the Company is in a
favorable position. The Company controls the credit risk associated with its
various derivative agreements through counterparty credit review, counterparty
exposure limits and monitoring procedures.

     The Company's use of derivative instruments reduces the effect that
changing interest rates may have on net interest income. The Company uses such
instruments to reduce the volatility of net interest income over an interest
rate cycle. The Company does not invest in leveraged derivative instruments.
During 2000, the Company did terminate interest rate exchange agreements and
interest rate cap agreements. However, during 1999, the Company did not
terminate any such agreements.

     Scheduled maturities of interest rate exchange agreements were as follows:

(1) As of December 31, 2000, the notional amount of interest rate exchange
    agreements in which the Company paid a fixed rate was $11.01 billion. The
    Company paid a variable rate for the remaining interest rate exchange
    agreements. The terms of each agreement had specific LIBOR or COFI reset and
    index requirements that resulted in different rates for each agreement. The
    rate represented the weighted average rate as of the last reset date for
    each agreement.

NOTE 21: FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The following estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the
Company using available market information and appropriate valuation
methodologies. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could
result from offering for sale at one time the Company's entire holdings of a
particular financial instrument. Because an active secondary market does not
exist for a portion of the Company's financial instruments, fair value estimates
were based on management's judgment concerning future expected loss experience,
current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial
instruments and other factors. In addition, considerable judgment was required
to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly,
the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the
Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market
assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the
estimated fair value amounts.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     Fair value estimates were determined for existing balance sheet and
off-balance sheet financial instruments, including derivative instruments,
without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the
value of certain assets and liabilities that were not considered financial
instruments. Significant assets that were not considered financial instruments
include premises and equipment, net tax assets, real estate held for investment,
foreclosed assets and intangible assets. In addition, the value of the servicing
rights for loans sold in which the MSR has not been capitalized was excluded
from the valuation. Deposit intangibles were also excluded from the fair value
estimates. Finally, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the
unrealized gains and losses could have a significant effect on fair value
estimates and have not been considered in any of the valuations.

     Assets and liabilities whose carrying amounts approximate fair value
include cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, investment in
FHLBs, checking accounts, savings accounts and MMDAs, and federal funds
purchased and commercial paper.

     The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial instrument as of December 31, 2000 and 1999:

     Cash and cash equivalents -- The carrying amount represented fair value.

     Available-for-sale securities -- Fair values were based on quoted market
prices. If a quoted market price was not available, fair value was estimated
using market prices for similar securities, as well as internal analysis.

     Held-to-maturity securities -- Fair values were based on quoted market
prices. If a quoted market price was not available, fair value was estimated
using market prices for similar securities, as well as internal analysis.

     Loans held for sale -- Fair values were derived from quoted market prices,
internal estimates and pricing of similar instruments.

     Loans held in portfolio -- Loans were priced using an option adjusted cash
flow valuation methodology. Fair values were derived from quoted market prices,
internal estimates and the pricing of similar instruments.

     MSR -- The fair value of MSR was estimated using projected cash flows,
adjusted for the effects of anticipated prepayments, using a market discount
rate. The fair value estimates exclude the value of the servicing rights for
loans sold in which the MSR has not been capitalized.

     Investment in FHLBs -- The carrying amount represented fair value. FHLB
stock does not have a readily determinable fair value and is required to be sold
back at its par value.

     Deposits -- The fair value of checking accounts, savings accounts and MMDAs
was the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. For time deposit
accounts, the fair value was determined using an option adjusted cash flow
methodology. The discount rate was derived from the rate currently offered on
alternate funding sources with similar maturities. Core deposit intangibles were
not included in the valuation.

     Federal funds purchased and commercial paper -- The value was determined
using an option adjusted cash flow methodology. The discount rate was derived
from the rate currently offered on similar borrowings.

     Repurchase agreements -- These were valued using an option adjusted cash
flow methodology. The discount rate was derived from the rate currently offered
on similar borrowings. The fair value of embedded purchased floors and caps was
determined using dealer quotations, when available. If a quoted market price was
not available, fair value was estimated using an internal analysis based on the
market prices of similar instruments.

     Advances from FHLBs -- These were valued using an option adjusted cash flow
methodology. The discount rate was derived from the rate currently offered on
similar borrowings.

     Trust preferred securities -- Fair values were based on quoted market
prices. If a quoted market price was not available, fair value was estimated
using market prices for similar securities.

     Other borrowings -- These were valued using an option adjusted cash flow
methodology. The discount rate was derived from the rate currently offered on
similar borrowings.

     Derivative financial instruments -- The fair value for interest rate
exchange agreements and interest rate cap agreements was determined using dealer
quotations, when available. If a quoted market price was not available, fair
value was estimated using an internal analysis based on the market prices of
similar instruments. The market prices for similar instruments were used to
value interest rate cap agreements.

     Forward sales contracts designated against loans -- The fair value of
forward sales contracts purchased as a hedge of fixed-rate commitments and
commitments to fund real estate loans was estimated using current market prices
adjusted for various risk factors and market volatility.

     Off-balance sheet loan commitments -- The fair value of loan commitments
was estimated based on current levels of interest rates versus the committed
interest rates. The balance shown represents the differential between committed
value and fair value.

     The estimated fair value of the Company's financial instruments was as
follows:

NOTE 23: OPERATING SEGMENTS

     Effective January 1, 2001, the Company realigned its business segments.
Separately, the Company is in the process of enhancing its segment reporting
process methodologies and allocations and will be reporting segment results
under these new methodologies and as realigned beginning with the first quarter
of 2001.

     For the historical periods presented in these financial statements, the
Company managed its business along five major operating segments: Consumer
Banking, Mortgage Banking, Commercial Banking, Financial Services, and Consumer
Finance. Although the Company did not consider the Treasury group to be an
operating segment, it managed investments and interest rate risk. Generally, MBS
that the Company purchased were allocated to Treasury.

     Each line of business is managed by a member of the Executive Committee
under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer. The Executive Committee,
which is the senior decision making group of the Company, is comprised of nine
members including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Other
Executive Committee members are responsible for managing the centralized support
functions.

     The financial performance of the business lines is measured by the
Company's profitability reporting process, which utilizes various management
accounting techniques to ensure that each business line's financial results
reflect the underlying performance of that business. To better assess the
profitability of its business lines, the Company generates segment results that
include balances directly attributable to business line activities as well as
balances that are allocated from traditionally undistributed units. In this way,
management can better assess the fully burdened performance of a particular
business line. Washington Mutual is constantly analyzing its line of business
performance and developing better ways to measure profitability.

     Consumer banking includes deposit products (with their related fee income)
and all consumer loan products originated through its financial centers. These
consumer loan products include second equity mortgage loans, lines of credit,
manufactured housing loans, automobile, boat and recreational vehicle loans, and
education loans. The principal activities conducted by mortgage banking are the
origination of SFR and residential construction loans, and all loan servicing
activities. Commercial banking offers a full range of commercial banking
products and services, including commercial business loans, multi-family
residential loans and loans secured by nonresidential real estate. Financial
Services offers a wide range of investment products to the Company's customers,
including mutual funds, variable and fixed annuities and general securities.
Consumer Finance offers direct consumer installment loans and retail sales
financing, and manages the Company's portfolio of purchased specialty mortgage
finance loans.

     Whenever feasible, revenues and expenses are directly assigned to business
lines in evaluating their performance. Some of the loans originated by the
Company's mortgage banking line of business are transferred to the consumer
banking line of business at a transfer price that reflects the risk-adjusted
value of such loans. Additionally, corporate overhead, centralized support
costs, and other costs are allocated to each business line based on appropriate
allocation methodologies.

     The organizational structure of the Company and the allocation
methodologies it employs result in business line financial results that are not
necessarily comparable across companies. As such, Washington Mutual's business
line performance may not be directly comparable with similar information from
other financial institutions.
