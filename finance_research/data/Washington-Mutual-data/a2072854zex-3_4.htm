matter. If less than a majority is represented, a majority of those represented may adjourn the meeting to such time and place as they may determine, without further notice, except as set forth in
Section&nbsp;3.6. Once a share is represented at a meeting, other than to object to holding the meeting or transacting business, it is deemed to be present for purposes of a quorum for the remainder
of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be fixed for the adjourned meeting. At such reconvened meeting, any business may be transacted which might
have been transacted at the adjourned meeting. If a quorum exists, action on a matter is approved by a voting group if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast
within the voting group opposing the action, unless the question is one upon which a different vote is required by express provision of law or of the articles of incorporation or of these bylaws. </FONT></P>
