</font></b>The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation and Benefits
Committee of the Board of Directors (the &#147;Committee&#148;), as such committee is
from time to time constituted. The Committee may delegate its duties and powers
in whole or in part (i) to any subcommittee thereof consisting solely of at
least two &#147;outside directors,&#148; as defined under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), or (ii) to the extent
consistent with Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, to any other individual or

powers to include the exclusive authority to select the employees to be granted
bonus awards (&#147;Bonuses&#148;) under the Plan, to determine the size and terms of the
Bonus to be made to each individual selected (subject to the limitation imposed
on &#147;Special Bonuses,&#148; as defined below), to modify the terms of any Bonus that
has been granted (except with respect to any modification which would increase
the amount of compensation payable to a &#147;Covered Employee,&#148; as such term is
defined in Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code), to determine the time when Bonuses
will be awarded, to establish performance objectives in respect to Bonuses and
to certify that such performance objectives were attained. The Committee is
authorized to interpret the Plan, to establish, amend and rescind any rules and
regulations relating to the Plan, and to make any other determinations that it
deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan. The Committee
may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in
the Plan in the manner and to the extent the Committee deems necessary or
desirable to carry it into effect. Any decision of the Committee in the
interpretation and administration of the Plan, as described herein, shall lie
within its sole and absolute discretion and shall be final, conclusive and
binding on all parties concerned. No member of the Committee and no officer of
the Company shall be liable for anything done or omitted to be done by him or
her, by any other member of the Committee or by any officer of the Company in
connection with the performance of duties under the Plan, except for his or her
own willful misconduct or as expressly provided by statute.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">(c) Special
Bonuses. (i) The Committee may in its discretion award a Bonus to a Participant
who it reasonably believes may be a Covered Employee (a &#147;Special Bonus&#148;) for
the taxable year of the Company in which such Bonus would be deductible, under
the terms and conditions of this subsection (c). Subject to clause (iii) of
this Section&nbsp;4(c), the amount of a Participant&#146;s Special Bonus shall be an
amount determinable from written performance goals approved by the Committee
while the outcome is substantially uncertain and no more than 90 days after the
commencement of the period to which the performance goal relates or, if less,
the number of days which is equal to 25 percent of the relevant performance
period. The maximum amount of any Special Bonus that may be granted in any
given fiscal year shall be 2.0% of the consolidated income of the Company and
its subsidiaries before taxes and dividends paid or payable on the Company&#146;s
trust preferred securities earned by the Company and its subsidiaries (as
stated in the Company&#146;s audited financial statements) in the fiscal year in
respect of which the Special Bonus is to be paid.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">(ii) The
amount of any Special Bonus will be based on objective performance goals
established by the Committee using one or more performance factors. The
performance criteria for Special Bonuses made under the Plan will be based upon
one or more of the following criteria: (A) before or after tax net income; (B)
earnings per share; (C) book value per share; (D) stock price; (E) return on
Stockholders&#146; equity; (F) expense management; (G) return on investment; (H)
improvements in capital structure; (I) profitability of an identifiable
business unit or product; (J) before or after tax profit margins; (K) budget
comparisons; (L) total return to Stockholders; and (M) the relative performance
of the Company against a peer group of companies on any of the measures above.
Participants who have primary responsibility for a business unit of the Company
may be measured on business unit operating profit, business unit operating
profit as a percent of revenue and/or measures related to business unit
profitability above its cost of capital, in place of some or all of the
corporate performance measures.</font></p>

respect to any affected Participant and, if they have, so certify and ascertain
the amount of the applicable Special Bonus. No Special Bonuses will be paid
until such certification is made by the Committee.</font></p>

the Company or its affiliates of the payment of Special Bonuses.</font></p>

The Participant may amend such beneficiary designation in writing at any time
prior to the Participant&#146;s death, without the consent of any previously
designated beneficiary. Such designation or amended designation, as the case
may be, shall not be effective unless and until received by the duly authorized
representatives of the Committee or its delegate prior to the Participant&#146;s
death. In the absence of any such designation, the amount payable, if any,
shall be delivered to the legal representative of such Participant&#146;s estate.</p>
