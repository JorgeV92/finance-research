      WHEREAS, Purchaser and Seller entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement
dated as of October 19, 2001(the "PSA"); and

      WHEREAS, Purchaser and Seller desire to amend the PSA as set for herein.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto covenant and agree as
follows:

      Section 4 of the PSA is deleted in its entirety and the following is
substituted in its place and stead:

            "4.   PURCHASE PRICE AND DEPOSIT.

            The purchase price to be paid by Purchaser to Seller for the
      Property (the "PURCHASE PRICE") is Seven Hundred Forty Eight Million
      Dollars ($748,000,000). The Purchase Price shall be allocated between: (a)
      Ground Leasehold - $458,852,685, (b) Building and Interior Improvements -
      $153,947,315 and (c) FF&E - $135,200,000. The Purchase Price shall be
      payable as follows:

                  (a) Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement by
      Purchaser, Purchaser is delivering directly to Fried, Frank, Harris,
      Shriver & Jacobson, as escrow agent ("ESCROW AGENT") by wire transfer the
      amount of One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000) (the "DEPOSIT"). The
      Deposit shall be held in an interest bearing escrow account by Escrow
      Agent in accordance with an escrow agreement between Seller, Purchaser and
      Escrow Agent, executed simultaneously herewith. The Deposit shall be
      delivered by Escrow Agent to Seller or Purchaser as hereinafter provided
      in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. All references in this
      Agreement to the Deposit shall mean the Deposit and all interest accrued
      thereon.

                  (b) At the Closing, Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit to
      Seller (it being understood that any interest on the Deposit shall not be
      credited to the Purchase Price) and Purchaser shall deliver the balance of
      the Purchase Price as follows:

                        (i) $619,500,000, subject to adjustment as provided in
      ARTICLE 7 to Seller; and

                        (ii) $28,500,000 to Escrow Agent, or such other party
      agreed to by the parties, as escrow agent, to be held and disbursed
      pursuant to the Agreement as to Post Closing Obligations, attached hereto
      as EXHIBIT 15 (the "POST CLOSING AGREEMENT").

                  (c) All monies payable by Purchaser under this Agreement,
      unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, shall be paid by wire
      transfer of immediately available federal funds for credit to such bank
      account or accounts specified by Seller, and divided into such amounts as
      may be required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
      Agreement.

                  As used in this Agreement, the term "BUSINESS DAY" shall mean
      every day other than Saturdays, Sundays, all days observed by the federal
      or New York State government as legal holidays and all days on which
      commercial banks in New York State are required by law to be closed.

                  (d) Except as otherwise specified in Sections 6(b), 12(a)(ii),
      13(a)(ii) and 20(b) of this Agreement, the Deposit shall be
      non-refundable. The provisions of this Section 4(d) shall survive the
      termination of this Agreement."

      Except as herein modified, the PSA is in full force and effect.
