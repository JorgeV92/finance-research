respect to Rights, either alone or together with other payments and benefits a
Grantee receives or is then entitled to receive from the Company, would
constitute a payment described in Section 280G(b) (2) (or its successors) of
the Internal Revenue Code (the &#147;Code&#148;), such payments and benefits provided to
Grantee shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion thereof
shall be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code; but
only if, by reason of such reduction, the net after tax benefit of Grantee
shall exceed the net after tax benefit if such reduction were not made.&#160; For this purpose, the determination as to
whether such payments and benefits constitute a payment described in Code
Section 280G (b) (2) and as to the amount of such reduction, if any, necessary
to avoid the excise tax shall be based upon the agreement of the Company and
the Grantee, or in the absence of such agreement, a determination by the
accounting firm as described in Section 4.2 below.&#160; In the event of a determination that such reduction is to take
place, the Grantee shall be entitled to designate which payments and benefits
shall be reduced, but in the event the Grantee fails to make such designation
within 15 days following notification of such determination, the Company shall
allocate the reduction among such payments and benefits in its sole discretion.</font></p>

Section 4 shall mean the sum of (i) the total payments payable to Grantee
hereunder, plus (ii) all other payments and benefits which the Grantee receives
or is then entitled to receive from the Company that would constitute a payment
described in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, less (iii) the amount of federal,
state and local income taxes payable with respect to the foregoing calculated
at the maximum marginal income tax rate for each year in which the foregoing
shall be paid to Grantee (based upon the rate in effect for such year as set
forth in the Code at the time of termination of Grantee&#146;s employment), less
(iv) the amount of excise taxes imposed with respect to the payments and
benefits described in (i) and (ii) above by Section 4999 of the Code.&#160; The foregoing calculations shall be made, at
the Company&#146;s expense, by the Company and Grantee.&#160; If no agreement on the calculations is reached, Grantee and the
Company shall agree to the selection of an accounting firm to make the
calculations.&#160; If no agreement can be
reached regarding the selection of an accounting firm, the Company shall select
a nationally recognized accounting firm which has no current or recent business
relationship with the Company.&#160; The determination
of any such firm selected shall be conclusive and binding on all parties.</font></p>

described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 above that payments with respect to Rights
are to be reduced pursuant to this Section 4 and if such determination occurs
after the Grantee has received payments as described in Section 2.2 without
such reduction having been made, the amount by which such payment is to be
reduced as provided in Section 4.2 above shall be deemed to be a loan from the
Company to the Grantee and shall be due and payable by the Grantee to the
Company three days following notification by the Company to the Grantee of such
determination and the amount owing.&#160; No
interest shall be due on such amount.</font></p>
