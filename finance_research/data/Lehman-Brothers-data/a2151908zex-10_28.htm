<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plan shall be known as the Lehman Brothers Holdings&nbsp;Inc. Retirement Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Plan"). The Plan shall be
maintained by Lehman Brothers Holdings&nbsp;Inc. ("Holdings") solely for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to persons who serve as directors of Holdings on or after the effective date of

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits payable under the Plan will be paid from Holdings general revenues as payments become due under the Plan, nor will the Plan be funded in advance
through a trust arrangement qualified under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or through insurance annuity contracts, and the Plan will not be subject to the jurisdiction of or be guaranteed by the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Holdings shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to assure the payments of benefits under the
Plan and the payment of benefits thereunder shall be subordinate to the claims of Holdings general creditors. </FONT></P>

count as one Year of Service. All Years of Service shall be counted for non-employee directors who serve as such after the effective date of the Plan. </FONT></P>
