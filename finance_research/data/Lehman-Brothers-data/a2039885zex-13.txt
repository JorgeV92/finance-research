FINANCIAL SUMMARY--FISCAL 2000

o Net revenue growth of 44%

o Net income increased 57%

o Pretax margin of 33.5%

o ROE of 27.4%(1)

(1) Before redeemable preferred dividend

For 2000, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ("Holdings") and subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Company" or "Lehman Brothers") reported its 6th consecutive
year of record financial performance.

Net income of $1,775 million increased 57% over 1999 while earnings per share of
$6.38 grew approximately 56% over last year. These results reflect the continued
successful execution of the Company's strategy to grow its high margin
investment banking and equities businesses; increase its presence in certain
businesses in Europe; and, at the same time, maintain a strict discipline with
regard to its expenses and risk management. Net revenues increased to a record
$7,707 million from $5,340 million in 1999 as the Company achieved record
revenues in each major business segment and region in which it operates. The
Company's emphasis on high margin businesses and disciplined approach to expense
management supported an increase in the Company's pretax operating margin to
33.5% in 2000 from 30.5% in 1999. Revenues in each of the Company's three
segments grew by over 30% compared to last year and return on equity increased
to 27.4% from 21.8% a year ago. As a result of the Company's continued emphasis
on expense discipline, non-personnel expenses increased only 19%, compared with
an overall increase of 44% in net revenues. The Company's compensation and
benefits ratio increased slightly to 51.0% of net revenues from 50.7% in 1999 as
the Company continued to increase headcount, making significant additions in
areas where the Company is focusing its growth.

The Company reported net income of $1,132 million and earnings per share of
$4.08 for 1999. Net revenues increased 30% from 1998 to $5.3 billion. The
Company's pretax operating margin was 30.5% for 1999 and 25.6% for 1998. The
compensation and benefits ratio was 50.7% of net revenues and non-personnel
expenses as a percentage of revenues was 18.8% compared to 23.7% in 1998. These
results reflected the continued implementation of the strategy to grow high
margin businesses while managing expenses carefully. For 1998, the Company
reported net income of $736 million and earnings per share of $2.60.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

The principal business activities of the Company are investment banking and
securities trading and sales, which by their nature are subject to volatility,
primarily due to changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and security
valuations, global economic and political trends and industry competition. As a
result, revenues and earnings may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and
from year to year.

The favorable market and economic conditions experienced during 1999 continued
into the first half of 2000, boosted by a wealth effect stemming from previous
gains in the stock market and strong consumer spending. In response to strong
growth and rising inflation fears, the Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds
rate by a total of 100 basis points to 6.50% over the first half of 2000, with
the last increase occurring on May 16, 2000. In the second half of the year,
marketplace uncertainties combined with slower consumer spending, higher
borrowing costs and recessionary fears resulted in weaker market conditions,
prompting the Federal Reserve to adopt an easing bias by year-end.

As a result of this changing economic climate, the U.S. equity markets were very
volatile during the year, posting lower returns when compared to the previous
several years. By the middle of January 2000, in anticipation of further Federal
Reserve Board rate hikes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ("DJIA") started to
decline, falling briefly below the 10,000 level before recovering through the
end of August. Following the Federal Reserve Board's fifty basis point
tightening in May, equity analysts started to lower their forecasts for the late
2000 and early 2001 quarters, a pattern that would continue through the end of
the fiscal year. In October, the DJIA again slipped below the 10,000 level
before recovering to 10,415 at November 30, 2000, a 4% decrease from fiscal
year-end 1999. The NASDAQ Composite experienced even greater volatility,
climbing 40% to an all-time high of 5,049 in early March, before slipping almost
50% during the second half of the year. The NASDAQ close of 2,598, represented a
22% decline for the year-ended November 30, 2000, the worst full year
performance since its inception in the early 1970s. The S&P 500 also closed
lower, marking the first time in a decade that all three major indexes would
finish the year with losses.

Europe was the only major region to register positive returns on equities for
the twelve months ended November 30, 2000. However, the 6% return in local
currency terms (FTSE World Europe Index) disguised a sharp sectoral divide. The
technology and telecommunications sectors had wide swings, rising 50% in value
during the three months ended February 2000, before losing 40% of their value in
the next three-quarters. Meanwhile, the rest of the market recorded a much
steadier performance, although the fourth quarter was weak across all sectors as
regional growth expectations began to deteriorate. Trading volumes were very
strong in the early months of the year, but dropped off significantly during the
second half of the year.

Asian Pacific markets were particularly weak for the year-ended November 30,
2000. The capital-weighted index of all shares listed on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange ("TOPIX index") lost 17% of its value during the year as the cyclical
recovery in Japan began losing momentum. Outside of Japan, Asian markets also
fell sharply during the year as the FTSE World Pacific Basin index was down 10%
for the year.

Equity new issuances reached record levels during the year with volumes up 23%
over the same period last year. Fueling the growth in the U.S. equity market was
increased IPO volume and continued equity raising in the technology,
telecommunication and new media sectors. Fourth quarter origination volumes,
however, were off significantly from the first nine months of the year as the
equity markets began to feel the affects of the market's downturn.

Overall, the fixed income market environment was sub-optimal in 2000. The U.S.
Treasury market was the lone exception, as it benefitted from many factors,
including the turbulence in the equity markets, increased U.S. Treasury
buybacks, lower volume of U.S. corporate debt issuance and revised forecasts for
higher future U.S. budget surpluses. This led to a strong performance in the
government bond sector during the second half of 2000. The credit market
environment was very difficult for virtually the entire year. Interest rates
were rising, the yield curve was inverted and credit spreads widened
significantly toward the end of the year due to uncertainty over the interest
rate environment and increased concerns over corporate credit quality and
defaults. This was most prominently seen in the high yield market, where spreads
widened to their highest levels since 1991.

European corporate bond market activity slowed significantly during the second
half of the year, primarily as a result of continued concerns around corporate
credit quality. Credit spreads widened moderately by year-end, leading to
underperformance of corporate bonds compared to government securities. Trading
activities also slowed, affected by volatile trading conditions in high profile
sectors such as telecommunications.

Global debt new issuances were dampened by the inversion of the yield curve and
the anticipation of future interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. However,
as it became apparent that the Federal Reserve was no longer aggressively
raising interest rates, market fundamentals improved in the second half of the
year. Overall, debt new issuances for the year were down approximately 15% from
1999. However, the high yield new issue market was down significantly,
approximately 50% from 1999, due to the spread widening in this sector.

Merger and acquisition advisory activities on a global basis reached record
levels in 2000, although fourth quarter results were significantly slower than
the rest of the year as volatility in equity markets affected the pace of
announced transactions. Overall, the volume of completed transactions for the
year soared to a record $3.4 trillion in 2000, which included the completion of
the highest ever number of deals greater than $1 billion. The increase was
influenced by activity involving European






                                       38

companies and cross-border mergers and acquisitions as the forces of
consolidation, deregulation and globalization across industry sectors continued
to drive strategic combinations.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company is segregated into the following three business segments (each of
which are described below): Investment Banking, Capital Markets and Client
Services. Each segment represents a grouping of activities and products with
similar characteristics. These business activities result in revenues from both
institutional and high-net-worth retail clients which are recognized across the
different revenue categories contained in the Company's Consolidated Statement
of Income. (Net revenues by segment also contain certain internal allocations,
including funding costs, which are centrally managed.)

Lehman Brothers provides a full array of capital market products and advisory
services worldwide. Through the Company's banking, research, trading,
structuring and distribution capabilities of equity and fixed income products
the Company continues its focus of building its client/customer business
model. These "customer flow" activities represent a majority of the Company's
revenues. In addition to its customer flow activities, the Company also takes
proprietary positions, the success of which is dependent upon its ability to
anticipate economic and market trends. The Company believes its customer flow
orientation mitigates its overall revenue volatility.

The Company, through its subsidiaries, is a market-maker in all major equity and
fixed income products in both the domestic and international markets. In order
to facilitate its trading activities, the Company is a member of all principal
securities and commodities exchanges in the United States and holds memberships
or associate memberships on several principal international securities and
commodities exchanges, including the London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Milan
and Paris stock exchanges. As part of its market-making customer flow
activities, the Company maintains inventory positions of varying amounts across
a broad range of financial instruments, which are marked-to-market on a daily
basis and, along with any proprietary trading positions, give rise to principal
transactions revenues.

Net revenues from the Company's market-making, sales and trading activities in
the capital markets are recognized as either principal transactions, commissions
or net interest revenues, depending upon the method of execution, financing
and/or hedging related to specific inventory positions. The Company evaluates
its sales and trading strategies on an overall profitability basis, which
combines principal transactions revenues, commissions and net interest.

INVESTMENT BANKING

o Net revenues increased 31% for the year

o Record merger and acquisition advisory fees of $777 million, up over 50% from
  a year ago

o Record equity underwriting revenues of $817 million, up 79% from 1999 on
  record lead managed underwriting volume of $14 billion

                        INVESTMENT BANKING - NET REVENUES

Presented is a bar graph illustrating Lehman Brothers Investment Banking Net
Revenues for the past three years as follows:

<TABLE>
<S>   <C>
1998  $1,401 million
1999  $1,664 million
2000  $2,179 million
</TABLE>

Also displayed is the cumulative annual growth rate from 1998 to 2000 of 25%.

This segment's net revenues result from fees earned by the Company for
underwriting public and private offerings of fixed income and equity securities,
and advising clients on merger and acquisition activities and other services.

Investment Banking's net revenues increased 31% in 2000 to $2,179 million from
$1,664 million in 1999 and $1,401 million in 1998, due principally to an
increase in equity underwriting and merger and acquisition advisory activities.
This increase in net revenues reflects the progress the Company has made in its
strategy to build its global investment banking franchise.

</TABLE>

Equity underwriting revenues increased 79% to $817 million driven by increased
issuances as well as the Company's improvement in lead-managed global equity
issuances and corresponding improvement in the competitive rankings per Thomson
Financial Securities Data Corp. ("TFSD"). Merger and acquisition advisory
revenues increased 54% to a record $777 million. These record results were
driven by an increase in the Company's market share for completed mergers and
acquisition transactions from 7.6% in 1999 to 9.8% in 2000, per TFSD.


                                       40
<PAGE>


Debt underwriting revenues decreased 17% to $585 million as a result of
challenging market conditions as rising interest rates led to decreased
underwriting volume across most fixed income products, most notably in the high
yield market where spreads were at their widest levels since 1991. Overall
market volumes for global debt underwriting and high yield issuances were down
14% and 52%, respectively, according to TFSD.

The increase in net revenues in Investment Banking in 1999 from 1998 reflected
the ongoing success in building-out this segment, as evidenced by the Company's
ability to execute several significant multiple product transactions for key
clients in equity and investment grade debt underwriting. In addition, the
Company also met a key strategic initiative in improving its ranking in
lead-managed initial public offerings and European-related transactions during
the year.

income products. These products include a wide range of cash, derivative,
secured financing and structured instruments.

Capital Markets' net revenues were $4,689 million for 2000, $3,093 million for
1999 and $2,113 million for 1998. The 52% increase in net revenues in 2000 is
primarily attributable to a significant increase in customer flow activities as
overall transaction volumes almost doubled 1999 levels.

</TABLE>

Net revenues from the equity component of Capital Markets increased 84% to
$2,629 million from $1,425 million in 1999. This performance reflects the
success of the continued development of the Company's equity franchise, a key
component of the Company's strategic focus on building high margin businesses.
Revenues benefited from strong customer flow activity across all equity products
and regions, in particular equity derivative and cash products. Also
contributing to the increase were higher revenues related to the Company's
Private Equity Investments.

Net revenues from the fixed income component of Capital Markets increased 24% to
$2,060 million from $1,668 million in 1999. The Company generated this
year-over-year increase in an extremely difficult market environment due to
strong activity across most fixed income instruments, especially in higher
margin structured products. Certain products, particularly high yield
instruments, experienced reduce flow activity due to the widening of spreads
resulting from ongoing credit concerns. These concerns led many institutional
investors toward more liquid types of fixed income products, such as government
and mortgage-backed securities.

The increase in net revenues in Capital Markets from 1998 to 1999 was primarily
due to significantly increased institutional customer flow activity across most
equity and fixed income products as the Company continued to invest in high
margin product areas.

</TABLE>

Client Services' net revenues for 2000 were $839 million compared to $583
million for 1999 and $599 million for 1998. The 44% increase in 2000 was driven
by record customer activity as the Company successfully increased the headcount
and productivity of its investment representatives. In October of 2000, the
Company acquired SG Cowen's high-net-worth group of 92 investment
representatives. This, combined with the Company's own hiring initiatives,
increased the number of investment representatives to 450 as of November 30,
2000. In addition, Private Equity management fees increased significantly as the
Company's assets under management increased 51% to $4.5 billion. This growth is
part of the Company's strategic expansion of its high margin businesses.

In 1999, Private Client revenues increased 10% to a record $573 million due to
increased productivity of its sales force which offset a reduction in realized
gains and incentive fees from the liquidation of private equity investments.

GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION

In fiscal 2000, the Company continued to strategically expand its international
franchise, with a particular focus in Europe. This expansion enabled the Company
to benefit from the continued globalization of financial markets driven by the
increase in cross-border transactions and client demand for global investment
products. International net revenues represented 42% of total net revenues in
2000, compared with only 28% in 1997.

During the year, the Company continued to invest significant resources in
expanding its European franchise as it expanded headcount by approximately 40%.
Since 1997, European headcount has nearly doubled. This growth is based on the
Company's belief that the European economy will continue the transformation
toward a more capital markets driven environment. Overall European revenues
increased 45% versus 1999 to approximately $2.4 billion, as the region
experienced significant growth in all business lines, particularly equity cash
and derivative products and the growth of investment banking.

The Company also saw increased revenues in the Asian Pacific region across most
equity and fixed income products.

Non-interest expenses in 2000 totaled $5,128 million, up 38% over 1999's
non-interest expenses of $3,709 million. The increase in non-interest expenses
was more than offset by the 44% increase in net revenues, highlighting the
Company's continued disciplined approach to expense management. This ongoing
focus on expenses is a key attribute of the Company's strategic objective of
increasing pretax operating margins. Nonpersonel expenses as a percentage of net
revenues decreased from 18.8% in 1999 to 15.5% in fiscal 2000.

Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenues increased
slightly to 51.0% compared to 50.7% in 1999. The increase reflects the Company's
continued expansion of its investment banking, equities and European franchises
as well as its investment in technology and e-commerce capabilities.
Compensation and benefits expense includes the cost of salaries, incentive
compensation and employee benefit plans as well as the amortization of deferred
stock compensation awards.

INCOME TAXES Lehman Brothers 2000 income tax provision of $748 million
represented a 29% effective tax rate. In 1999 and 1998, income tax provisions
were $457 million and $316 million, respectively, resulting in effective tax
rates of 28% in 1999 and 30% in 1998. The effective tax rate increased in 2000
due to an overall increase in the level of pretax income, which lessened the
relative impact of certain tax preference items. The increase was partially
offset by a decrease in the state and local effective tax rate. Additional
information about the Company's income taxes can be found in Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

LIQUIDITY, FUNDING AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT Liquidity risk management is of critical importance to
the Company, providing a framework which seeks to ensure that the Company
maintains sufficient liquid financial resources to continually fund its balance
sheet and meet all of its funding obligations in all market environments. The
Company's liquidity framework has been structured so that even in a severe
liquidity event the balance sheet does not have to be reduced purely for
liquidity reasons (although we may choose to do so for risk reasons). This
allows the Company to continue to maintain its customer franchise and debt
ratings during a liquidity event.

The Company's liquidity management philosophy incorporates the following
principles:

o     Liquidity providers are credit and market sensitive. Consequently, firms
      must be in a state of constant liquidity readiness.
o     Firms should not rely on asset sales to generate cash or believe that they
      can increase unsecured borrowings or funding efficiencies in a liquidity
      crisis.
o     During a liquidity event, certain secured lenders may require higher
      quality collateral. Firms must therefore not overestimate the availability
      of secured financing, and must fully integrate their secured and unsecured
      funding strategies.
o     A firm's legal entity structure may constrain liquidity. Regulatory
      requirements can restrict the flow of funds between regulated and
      unregulated group entities and this must be accounted for in liquidity
      planning.


                                       43
<PAGE>

The Company's Funding Framework incorporates these principles and mitigates
liquidity risk wherever possible. This Framework comprises four major
components:

1.    The Cash Capital Model--which evaluates the amount of long-term
      liabilities--with remaining maturities of over one year--that are
      required to fund the Company. The model incorporates that the
      following must be funded with cash capital:

o     Secured funding "haircuts," to reflect the estimated value of cash that
      would be advanced to the Company by counterparties during a stress
      environment.
o     Fixed assets and goodwill.
o     Operational cash at banks and unpledged assets independent of collateral
      quality; the Company assumes that it will not be able to operate with
      lower requirements in a stress environment than the Company currently
      operates with in a normal environment.

The Company operates with a surplus of cash capital sources over cash capital
uses. To ensure that the Company is always operating "within its means," the
businesses operate within strict cash capital limits. This limit culture has
been institutionalized and this policy engages the entire Company in managing
liquidity.

2.    The Reliable Secured Funding Model ("RSFM")--which forecasts the reliable
      sources of overnight secured funding available to the Company.

The RSFM represents our assessment of the reliable secured funding capacity, by
asset class, that we would anticipate in a liquidity event. The Company pays
careful attention to validating this capacity through a periodic counterparty by
counterparty, product by product review which draws upon the Company's
understanding of the financing franchise and experience.

In cases where a business has inventory at a level above its RSFM, the Company
requires the excess to be funded on a term basis with a maturity in excess of
three months. If this is not feasible, the Company will then provide for this in
its liquidity cushion--a cash amount with a remaining term in excess of 90 days.
The cost of maintaining the liquidity cushion is borne by the business and
encourages the development of secured funding capacity in line with balance
sheet growth.

The Company has increased RSFM for certain asset classes through the use of
favorable legal entity structures, such as Lehman Brothers Bank (Thrift) and
Lehman Brothers Bankhaus. These entities operate in a deposit protected
environment and are therefore able to source low cost unsecured funds that are
insulated from a companywide or market specific event, while providing reliable
funding for mortgage products and other loan assets.

3.    The Maximum Cumulative Outflow ("MCO")--which estimates the size of the
      added liquidity requirement necessary to fund contingent cash outflows
      expected from a stress environment.

The MCO model reflects our posture of constant liquidity readiness. On an
ongoing basis, the Company projects, for our regulated and unregulated entities,
the amount of cash we would have over the next three months, assuming that we
immediately experience a very severe liquidity stress environment. The MCO
assumptions, which presume a very severe liquidity stress environment, include
the following:

o     The Company is temporarily unable to replace maturing commercial paper and
      long-term debt.
o     Collateral posting requirements increase as counterparties call for
      additional collateral.
o     Contingent commitments are drawn as other liquidity-impacted institutions
      draw on their contractual facilities.
o     The Company does not have to draw on its committed back-stop facilities.
o     Secured funding consumes additional cash as haircuts widen to reflect
      stress levels.

The Company's MCO standard is to operate in such a manner that even if a severe
liquidity event ensues, three months forward the Company retains a substantial
level of cash in both its regulated and unregulated subsidiaries.




                                       44
<PAGE>



4.    The Contingency Funding Plan--which represents a detailed action plan to
      manage a stress liquidity event within the Company.

The Company has developed a comprehensive Funding Action Plan to manage
liquidity risk and communicate effectively with creditors, investors and
customers during a funding crisis. The main focus of the plan is to detail how,
in practice, we would manage our liquidity in a real situation, using the three
components discussed above.

As a consequence of implementing its Funding Framework, the Company has
generally shifted to longer-term funding over the past several years. As a
result, the Company has reduced its reliance on short-term unsecured debt, which
represents only 4% of adjusted total assets and less than 15% of total debt.

Lehman Brothers has lowered its Short-Term Debt to Adjusted Total Assets and its
Short-Term Debt to Total ratios over the past four years to lessen the impact
short-term dislocations in unsecured funding markets. Lehman Brothers has
considerably lower ratios than its peer group.

MANAGING LIQUIDITY, FUNDING AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company's Finance
Committee is responsible for developing, implementing and enforcing the
liquidity, funding and capital policies. These policies include recommendations
for capital and balance sheet size as well as the allocation of capital and
balance sheet to the business units. Through the establishment and enforcement
of capital and funding limits, the Company's Finance Committee seeks to ensure
compliance throughout the organization so that the Company is not exposed to
undue risk.

TOTAL CAPITAL The Company's Total Capital (defined as long-term debt, preferred
securities subject to mandatory redemption and stockholders' equity) increased
16% to $43.9 billion at November 30, 2000, compared to $37.7 billion at November
30, 1999. The increase in Total Capital resulted from a net increase in
long-term debt, the retention of earnings, the net impact of various stock-based
employee awards and the issuance of $250 million of Series E Preferred Stock.
These were partially offset by repurchases of common stock (to fund stock-based
employee awards) and $88 million of convertible Series B Preferred Stock.

During 2000, the Company issued $14.2 billion in long-term debt, which was $5.7
billion in excess of its maturing debt. Long-term debt increased to $35.2
billion at November 30, 2000 from $30.7 billion at November 30, 1999, with a
weighted- average maturity of 3.8 years at November 30, 2000 and 3.7 years at
November 30, 1999.

The Company operates in many regulated businesses that require various minimum
levels of capital. These businesses are also subject to regulatory requirements
that may restrict the free flow of funds to affiliates. Regulatory approval is
generally required for paying dividends in excess of certain established levels,
making affiliated investments and entering into management and service
agreements with affiliated companies. Additional information about the Company's
capital requirements can be found in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITIES Holdings maintains a Revolving Credit Agreement (the
"Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of banks. Under the terms of the Credit
Agreement, the banks have committed to provide up to $2 billion for up to 364
days. Any loans outstanding on the commitment termination date may be extended
for up to an additional year at the option of Holdings. The Credit Agreement
contains covenants, which require, among other things that the Company maintain
specified levels of liquidity and tangible net worth.

In July 2000, the Company entered into a $1 billion Committed Securities
Repurchase Facility (the "Facility") for Lehman Brothers International (Europe)
("LBIE"), the Company's major operating entity in Europe. The Facility provides
secured multi-currency financing for a broad range of collateral types. Under
the terms of the Facility, the bank group will agree to provide funding for up
to one year on a secured basis. Any loans outstanding on the commitment
termination date may be extended for up to an additional year at the option of
LBIE. The Facility contains convenants that require, among other things, that
LBIE maintain specified levels of tangible net worth.

There are no borrowings outstanding under either the Credit Agreement or the
Facility. The Company may use the Credit Agreement and the Facility for general
corporate purposes from time to time. The Company has maintained compliance with
the applicable covenants for both the Credit Agreement and the Facility at all
times.

BALANCE SHEET The Company's total assets increased to $224.7 billion at November
30, 2000 from $192.2 billion at November 30, 1999. The Company's adjusted total
assets, defined as total assets less the lower of securities purchased under
agreements to resell or securities sold under agreements to repurchase, were
$143.5 billion at November 30, 2000 compared to $130.0 billion at November 30,
1999. The Company believes adjusted total assets is a more effective measure of
evaluating balance sheet usage when comparing companies in the securities
industry. The increase in adjusted total assets reflects a higher level of
securities owned associated with increased customer flow activities across the
Capital Markets businesses, principally in the Company's equity businesses.

The Company's balance sheet consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents,
securities and other financial instruments owned, and collateralized short-term
financing agreements. The liquid nature of these assets provides the Company
with flexibility in financing and managing its business. The majority of these
assets are funded on a secured basis through collateralized short-term financing
agreements.

FINANCIAL LEVERAGE Balance sheet leverage ratios are one measure used to
evaluate the capital adequacy of a company. Leverage ratios are commonly
calculated using either total assets or adjusted total assets divided by total
stockholders' equity and preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption.
The Company believes that the adjusted leverage ratio is a more effective
measure of financial risk when comparing companies in the securities industry.
The Company's leverage ratios based on adjusted total assets were 16.6x and
18.6x as of November 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Consistent with
maintaining a single A credit rating, the Company targets an adjusted leverage
ratio of approximately 20.0x. The Company operated below this level at November
30, 2000 principally due to the sub-optimal market environment at year-end. Due
to the nature of the Company's sales and trading activities, the overall size of
the Company's balance sheet fluctuates from time to time and at specific points
in time may be higher than the fiscal year-end or quarter-end amounts.

CREDIT RATINGS The Company, like other companies in the securities industry,
relies on external sources to finance a significant portion of its day-to-day
operations. The Company's access to and cost of funding is generally dependent
upon its short- and long-term debt ratings. On November 3, 2000, Moody's
Investors Service upgraded Holdings senior debt from A3 to A2 and commercial
paper from P-2 to P-1. As of November 30, 2000 the short- and long-term debt
ratings of Holdings and Lehman Brothers Inc. ("LBI") were as follows:

HIGH YIELD SECURITIES The Company underwrites, trades, invests and makes markets
in high yield corporate debt securities. The Company also syndicates, trades and
invests in loans to below investment grade-rated companies. For purposes of this
discussion, high yield debt instruments are defined as securities or loans to
companies rated BB+ or lower, or equivalent ratings by recognized credit rating
agencies, as well as non-rated securities or loans which, in the opinion of
management, are non-investment grade. Non-investment grade securities generally
involve greater risks than investment grade securities due to the issuer's
creditworthiness and the liquidity of the market for such securities. In
addition, these issuers have relatively higher levels of indebtedness, resulting
in an increased sensitivity to adverse economic conditions. The Company
recognizes these risks and aims to reduce market and credit risk through the
diversification of its products and counterparties. High yield debt instruments
are carried at fair value, and unrealized gains or losses for these securities
are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. Such
instruments at November 30, 2000 and 1999 included long positions with an
aggregate market value of approximately $3.5 billion and $3.0 billion,
respectively, and short positions with an aggregate market value of
approximately $745 million and $290 million, respectively. The Company mitigates
its aggregate and single-issuer net exposure through the use of derivatives,
sole-recourse securitization financing and other financial instruments.

Additional information about the Company's high yield securities and lending
activities, including related commitments, can be found in Note 14 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

PRIVATE EQUITY The Company has investments in twenty private equity
partnerships, for which the Company acts as general partner, as well as related
direct investments. At November 30, 2000 and 1999, the Company's investment in
these partnerships totaled $149 million and $134 million, respectively, and
direct investments totaled $678 million and $375 million, respectively. The
Company's policy is to carry its investments, including the appreciation of its
general partnership interests, at fair value based upon the Company's assessment
of the underlying investments. Additional information about the Company's
private equity activities, including related commitments, can be found in Note
14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES

OVERVIEW Derivatives are financial instruments, which include swaps, options,
futures, forwards and warrants, whose value is based upon an underlying asset
(e.g., treasury bond), index (e.g., S&P 500) or reference rate (e.g., LIBOR). A
derivative contract may be traded on an exchange or negotiated in the
over-the-counter markets. Exchange-traded derivatives are standardized and
include futures, warrants and certain option contracts listed on an exchange.
Over-the-counter ("OTC") derivative contracts are individually negotiated
between contracting parties and include forwards, swaps and certain options,
including caps, collars and floors. The use of derivative financial instruments
has expanded significantly over the past decade. One reason for this expansion
is that derivatives provide a cost-effective alternative for managing market
risk. In this regard, derivative contracts provide a reduced funding alternative
for managing market risk since derivatives are based upon notional amounts,
which are generally not exchanged, but rather are used merely as a basis for
exchanging cash flows during the duration of the contract. Derivatives are also
utilized extensively as highly effective tools that enable users to adjust risk
profiles,


                                       47
<PAGE>


such as interest rate, currency, or other market risks, since OTC derivative
instruments can be tailored to meet individual client needs. Additionally,
derivatives provide users with access to market risk management tools that
are often unavailable in traditional cash instruments. Derivatives can also
be used to take proprietary trading positions.

Derivatives are subject to various risks similar to non-derivative financial
instruments including market, credit and operational risk. Market risk is the
potential for a financial loss due to changes in the value of derivative
financial instruments due to market changes, including changes in interest
rates, foreign exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. Credit risk
results from the possibility that a counterparty to a derivative transaction
may fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Therefore, the
Company's exposure to credit risk is represented by its net receivable from
derivative counterparties, after consideration of collateral. Operational
risk is the possibility of financial loss resulting from a deficiency in the
Company's systems for executing derivative transactions. In addition to these
risks, counterparties to derivative financial instruments may also be exposed
to legal risks related to derivative activities, including the possibility
that a transaction may be unenforceable under applicable law. The risks of
derivatives should not be viewed in isolation but rather should be considered
on an aggregate basis along with the Company's other trading-related
activities.

As derivative products have continued to expand in volume, so has market
participation and competition. As a result, additional liquidity has been added
into the markets for conventional derivative products, such as interest rate
swaps. Competition has also contributed to the development of more complex
products structured for specific clients. It is this rapid growth and complexity
of certain derivative products, which has led to the perception, by some, that
derivative products are unduly risky to users and the financial markets. In
order to remove the public perception that derivatives may be unduly risky and
to ensure ongoing liquidity of derivatives in the marketplace, the Company
supports the efforts of the regulators in striving for enhanced risk management
disclosures which consider the effects of both derivative products and cash
instruments. In addition, the Company supports the activities of regulators that
are designed to ensure that users of derivatives are fully aware of the nature
of risks inherent within derivative transactions. As evidence of this support,
the Company is an active participant in the Derivative Policy Group and has been
actively involved with the various regulatory and accounting authorities in the
development of additional enhanced reporting requirements related to
derivatives. The Company strongly believes that derivatives provide significant
value to the financial markets and is committed to providing its clients with
innovative products to meet their financial needs.

LEHMAN BROTHERS' USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS In the normal course of business,
the Company enters into derivative transactions both in a trading capacity and
as an end user. As an end user, the Company utilizes derivative products to
adjust the interest rate nature of its funding sources from fixed to floating
interest rates, and to change the index upon which floating interest rates are
based (e.g., Prime to LIBOR) (collectively, "End User Derivative Activities").
For a further discussion of the Company's End User Derivative Activities, see
Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company utilizes derivative products in a trading capacity both as a dealer
to satisfy the financial needs of its clients and in each of its trading
businesses (collectively, "Trading-Related Derivative Activities"). The
Company's use of derivative products in its trading businesses is combined with
cash instruments to fully execute various trading strategies.

The Company conducts its derivative activities through a number of wholly-owned
subsidiaries. The Company's fixed income derivative products business is
conducted through its special purpose subsidiary, Lehman Brothers Special
Financing Inc., and separately capitalized "AAA" rated subsidiaries, Lehman
Brothers Financial Products Inc. and Lehman Brothers Derivative Products Inc.
The Company's equity derivative product business is conducted through Lehman
Brothers Finance S.A. In addition, as a global investment bank, the Company is
also a market-maker in a number of foreign currencies and actively trades in the
global commodity markets. Counterparties to the Company's derivative product
transactions are primarily financial intermediaries (U.S. and foreign banks),
securities firms, corporations, governments and their agencies, finance
companies, insurance companies, investment companies and pension funds.

The Company manages the risks associated with derivatives on an aggregate basis,
along with the risks associated with its non-derivative trading and
market-making activities in cash instruments, as part of its firmwide risk
management policies. For a further discussion of the Company's risk management
policies refer to the discussion which follows.

See Notes 1 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of
the Company's accounting polices and a further discussion of the Company's
Trading-Related Derivative Activities.

RISK MANAGEMENT

As a leading global investment banking company, risk is an inherent part of the
Company's businesses. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty
and subject participants to a variety of risks. The Company has developed
policies and procedures to identify, measure and monitor each of the risks
involved in its trading, brokerage and investment banking activities on a global
basis. The principal risks of Lehman Brothers are market, credit, liquidity,
legal and operational risks. Risk Management is considered to be of paramount
importance. Consequently, the Company devotes significant resources across all
of its worldwide trading operations to the measurement, management and analysis
of risk, including investments in personnel and technology.

The Company seeks to reduce risk through the diversification of its businesses,
counterparties and activities in geographic regions. The Company accomplishes
this objective by allocating the usage of capital to each of its businesses,
establishing trading limits for individual products and traders and setting
credit limits for individual counterparties, including regional concentrations.
The Company seeks to achieve adequate returns from each of its businesses
commensurate with the risks that they assume.

Overall risk management policy is established by a Risk Management Committee
(the "Committee") comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, the Global Risk
Manager, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Administrative Officer and the
Heads of Capital Markets and Investment Banking. The Committee brings together
senior management with the sole intent of discussing risk-related issues and
provides an effective forum for managing risk at the highest levels within the
Company. The Committee meets on a monthly basis, or more frequently if required,
to discuss, among other matters, significant market exposures, concentrations of
positions (e.g., counterparty, market risk), potential new transactions or
positions and risk limit exceptions.

The Global Risk Management Group (the "Group") supports the Committee, is
independent of the trading areas and reports directly to the Chief Executive
Officer. The Group combines two departments, credit risk management and market
risk management, into one unit. This facilitates the analysis of counterparty
credit and market risk exposures and leverages personnel and information
technology resources in a cost-efficient manner. The Group maintains staff in
each of the Company's regional trading centers and has daily contact with
trading staff at all levels within the Company. These discussions include a
review of trading positions and risk exposures.

CREDIT RISK Credit risk represents the possibility that a counterparty will be
unable to honor its contractual obligations to the Company. Credit risk
management is therefore an integral component of the Company's overall risk
management framework. The Credit Risk Management Department ("CRM Department")
has global responsibility for implementing the Company's overall credit risk
management framework.

The CRM Department manages the credit exposure related to trading activities by
giving initial credit approval for counterparties, establishing credit limits by
counterparty, country and industry group and by requiring collateral in
appropriate circumstances. In addition, the CRM Department strives to ensure
that master netting agreements are obtained whenever possible. The CRM
Department also considers the duration of transactions in making its credit
decisions, along with the potential credit exposure for complex derivative
transactions. The CRM Department is responsible for the continuous monitoring
and review of counterparty credit exposure and creditworthiness and recommending
valuation adjustments where appropriate. Credit limits are reviewed periodically
to ensure that they remain appropriate in light of market events or the
counterparty's financial condition.

MARKET RISK Market risk represents the potential change in value of a portfolio
of financial instruments due to changes in market rates, prices and
volatilities. Market risk management also is an essential component of the
Company's overall risk management framework. The Market Risk Management
Department ("MRM Department") has global responsibility for implementing the
Company's overall market risk management framework. It is responsible for the
preparation and dissemination of risk reports, developing and implementing the
firmwide Risk Management Guidelines and evaluating adherence to these


                                       49
<PAGE>


guidelines. These guidelines provide a clear framework for risk management
decision-making. To that end the MRM Department identifies and quantifies
risk exposures, develops limits, and reports and monitors these risks with
respect to the approved limits. The identification of material market risks
inherent in positions includes, but is not limited to, interest rate, equity
and foreign exchange risk exposures. In addition to these risks, the MRM
Department also evaluates liquidity risks, credit and sovereign
concentrations.

The MRM Department utilizes qualitative as well as quantitative information in
managing trading risk, believing that a combination of the two approaches
results in a more robust and complete approach to the management of trading
risk. Quantitative information is developed from a variety of risk methodologies
based upon established statistical principles. To ensure high standards of
qualitative analysis, the MRM Department has retained seasoned risk managers
with the requisite experience and academic and professional credentials.

Market risk is present in cash products, derivatives and contingent claim
structures that exhibit linear as well as non-linear profit and loss
sensitivity. The Company's exposure to market risk varies in accordance with the
volume of client driven market-making transactions, the size of the Company's
proprietary and arbitrage positions and the volatility of financial instruments
traded. The Company seeks to mitigate, whenever possible, excess market risk
exposures through the use of futures and option contracts and offsetting cash
market instruments.

The Company participates globally in interest rate, equity and foreign exchange
markets. The Company's Fixed Income division has a broadly diversified market
presence in U.S. and foreign government bond trading, emerging market
securities, corporate debt (investment and non-investment grade), money market
instruments, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities,
municipal bonds and interest rate derivatives. The Company's Equities division
facilitates domestic and foreign trading in equity instruments, indices and
related derivatives. The Company's foreign exchange businesses are involved in
trading currencies on a spot and forward basis as well as through derivative
products and contracts.

The Company incurs short-term interest rate risk when facilitating the orderly
flow of customer transactions through the maintenance of government and
high-grade corporate bond inventories. Market-making in high yield instruments
exposes the Company to additional risk due to potential variations in credit
spreads. Trading in international markets exposes the Company to spread risk
between the term structure of interest rates in differing countries. Mortgages
and mortgage-related securities are subject to prepayment risk and changes in
the level of interest rates. Trading in derivatives and structured products
exposes the Company to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates.
The Company actively manages interest rate risk through the use of interest rate
futures, options, swaps, forwards and offsetting cash market instruments.
Inventory holdings, concentrations and agings are monitored closely and used by
management to selectively hedge or liquidate undesirable exposures.

The Company is a significant intermediary in the global equity markets through
its market-making in U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities, including common
stock, convertible debt, exchange-traded and OTC equity options, equity swaps
and warrants. These activities expose the Company to market risk as a result of
price and volatility changes in its equity inventory. Inventory holdings are
also subject to market risk resulting from concentrations and liquidity that may
adversely impact market valuation. Equity market risk is actively managed
through the use of index futures, exchange-traded and OTC options, swaps and
cash instruments.

The Company enters into foreign exchange transactions in order to facilitate the
purchase and sale of non-dollar instruments, including equity and interest rate
securities. The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk on its holdings of
non-dollar assets and liabilities. The Company is active in many foreign
exchange markets and has exposure to the euro, Japanese yen, British pound,
Swiss franc and Canadian dollar as well as a variety of developed and emerging
market currencies. The Company hedges its risk exposures primarily through the
use of currency forwards, swaps, futures and options.

VALUE-AT-RISK For purposes of Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") risk
disclosure requirements, the Company discloses an entity-wide value-at-risk for
virtually all of its trading activities. In general, value-at-risk measures
potential loss of revenues at a given confidence level over a specified time
horizon. Value-at-risk over a one-day holding period measured at a 95%
confidence level implies that potential loss of daily trading revenue will be at
least as large as the value-at-risk amount on one out of every 20 trading days.




                                       50
<PAGE>



The Company's methodology estimates a reporting day value-at-risk using actual
daily trading revenues over the previous 250 trading days. This estimate is
measured as the loss, relative to the median daily trading revenue. The Company
also estimates an average value-at-risk measure over 250 rolling reporting days,
thus looking back a total of 500 trading days.

The Company's average value-at-risk for each component of market risk, and in
total was as follows (in millions):

Total Company                                          $20.8             $30.9
================================================================================
</TABLE>

During 2000, the Company's value-at-risk varied from a high of $23.7 million to
a low of $18.4 million. During 1999, the Company's value-at-risk varied from a
high of $36.2 million to a low of $19.0 million.

Average value-at-risk decreased in 2000 compared to 1999 due to the effects on
the 1999 value-at-risk related to the extreme market volatility experienced
during the August-October 1998 period. Excluding the data points during this
volatile time period, the adjusted average value-at-risk was $18.9 million
during 1999. Value-at-risk at November 30, 2000 and 1999 was $23.7 million and
$19.2 million, respectively.

Value-at-risk is one measure of potential loss in trading revenues that may
result from adverse market movements over a specified period of time with a
selected likelihood of occurrence. As with all measures of value-at-risk, the
Company's estimate has substantial limitations due to its reliance on historical
performance, which is not necessarily a predictor of the future. Consequently,
this value-at-risk estimate is only one of a number of tools the Company
utilizes in its daily risk management activities.

As discussed throughout the Management's Discussion and Analysis, the Company
seeks to reduce risk through the diversification of its businesses and a focus
on customer flow activities. This diversification and focus, combined with the
Company's risk management controls and processes, helps mitigate the net revenue
volatility inherent in the Company's trading activities. Although historical
performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance, the Company
believes its focus on business diversification and customer flow activities
should continue to help mitigate the volatility of future net trading revenues.

NEW ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"), which requires all derivatives
to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. In June 1999, the FASB issued
FASB No. 137 which extended the implementation date of SFAS No. 133 by one year.
In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, which amended SFAS 133. The Company
will adopt SFAS 133 as amended on December 1, 2000 (Fiscal Year 2001).

SFAS 133 will not affect the accounting for the Company's trading-related
derivative activities, as such derivatives are already recognized on a
mark-to-market basis through earnings. Rather, SFAS 133 will affect the
accounting for derivatives utilized as hedging instruments as part of the
Company's end-user activities. As an end user, the Company primarily utilizes
derivatives to modify the interest rate characteristics of its long-term debt
and secured financing activities ("end-user derivative activities"). The Company
currently accounts for its end-user derivative activities on an accrual basis
provided that the derivative is deemed a highly effective hedge. SFAS 133
generally will require the Company to recognize its end-user derivatives at fair
value through earnings, with an offset recognized through earnings for changes
in the fair value of the hedged item. Any ineffectiveness in a hedging
relationship generally will require immediate earnings recognition. In addition
to these changes, SFAS 133 will result in certain derivatives no longer
qualifying for hedge accounting, requiring such derivatives to be
marked-to-market through earnings without offset. Derivatives that will not
qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133 include U.S. dollar and foreign
currency basis swaps.




                                       51
<PAGE>



The Company has devoted significant resources to prepare for the adoption of
SFAS 133. The adoption of SFAS 133 will not have a material impact to the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

In September 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities--a replacement
of FASB No. 125." ("SFAS 140"). SFAS 140 carries over the fundamental control
premise of SFAS No. 125, which requires an entity to recognize only assets it
controls and to derecognize assets only when control has been surrendered. SFAS
140 amends the control framework of SFAS 125 by revising the criteria to be used
for evaluating whether a financial asset is controlled and providing new
criteria necessary to meet the definition of a Qualifying Special Purpose Entity
("QSPE"). A QSPE is a limited-purpose vehicle often used for asset
securitizations.

SFAS 140 will also change the accounting for collateral. SFAS 140 will no longer
require entities to recognize controlled collateral as an asset on the balance
sheet. Rather, SFAS 140 will require entities to separately classify financial
assets owned and pledged. SFAS 140 also requires new disclosures for collateral
and retained interests in securitizations.

SFAS 140 has multiple effective dates. The accounting for new transfers of
financial assets will begin March 31, 2001 unless grandfathering provisions have
been met. The collateral accounting and disclosure rules are effective for the
financial statement period ending after December 15, 2000. The adoption of SFAS
140 is not expected to have a material impact to the Company's financial
position or results of operations.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION

Because the Company's assets are, to a large extent, liquid in nature, they are
not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation affects
the Company's expenses, such as employee compensation, office space leasing
costs and communications charges, which may not be readily recoverable in the
price of services offered by the Company. To the extent inflation results in
rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets,
it may adversely affect the Company's financial position and results of
operations in certain businesses.

NOTE 1 / SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ("Holdings") and subsidiaries (collectively,
the "Company" or "Lehman Brothers"). Lehman Brothers is one of the leading
global investment banks serving institutional, corporate, government and
high-net-worth individual clients and customers. The Company's worldwide
headquarters in New York and regional headquarters in London and Tokyo are
complemented by offices in additional locations in North America, Europe, the
Middle East, Latin America and the Asia Pacific Region. The Company is engaged
primarily in providing financial services. The principal U.S. subsidiary of
Holdings is Lehman Brothers Inc. ("LBI"), a registered broker-dealer in the U.S.
All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles which require management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing
its financial statements are reasonable and prudent. Actual results could differ

SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Securities and other financial
instruments owned and securities and other financial instruments sold but not
yet purchased are valued at market or fair value, as appropriate, with
unrealized gains and losses reflected in Principal transactions in the
Consolidated Statement of Income. Market value is generally based on listed
market prices. If listed market prices are not available, fair value is
determined based on other relevant factors, including broker or dealer price
quotations and valuation pricing models which take into account time value and
volatility factors underlying the financial instruments.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS A derivative is typically defined as an
instrument whose value is "derived" from an underlying instrument, index or
rate, such as a future, forward, swap, or option contract, or other financial
instrument with similar characteristics. A derivative contract generally
represents future commitments to exchange interest payment streams or currencies
based on the contract or notional amount or to purchase or sell other financial
instruments at specified terms on a specified date.

Derivatives utilized for trading purposes are recorded at market or fair value
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition on a net by counterparty
basis where a legal right of set-off exists and are netted across products when
such provisions are stated in the master netting agreement. The market or fair
value related to swap and forward transactions, as well as options and warrants,
is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as an asset or
liability in Derivatives and other contractual agreements, as appropriate.
Margin on futures contracts is included in receivables and payables, as
applicable. Changes in fair values of derivatives are recorded as principal
transactions revenues in the current period. Market or fair value for
trading-related instruments is generally determined by either quoted market
prices (for exchange-traded futures and options) or pricing models (for
over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options). Pricing models utilize a series
of market inputs to determine the present value of future cash flows, with
adjustments, as required for credit risk and liquidity risk. Further valuation
adjustments may be recorded, as deemed appropriate for new or complex products
or for positions with significant concentrations. These adjustments are integral
components of the mark-to-market process. Credit-related valuation adjustments
incorporate business and economic conditions, historical experience,
concentrations, estimates of expected losses and the character, quality and
performance of credit sensitive financial instruments.

The Company enters into various derivative financial instruments for non-trading
purposes as an end user to modify the market risk exposures of certain assets
and liabilities. In this regard, the Company utilizes interest rate and currency
swaps to modify the interest rate and foreign currency exposure of existing
assets and liabilities. The Company also utilizes equity derivatives to hedge
its exposure to equity price risk embedded in certain of its debt obligations.
In addition to modifying the interest rate and foreign currency exposure of
existing assets and liabilities, the Company utilizes derivative financial
instruments as an end user to modify the interest rate characteristics of
certain anticipated transactions related to its secured financing activities,
where there is a high degree of certainty that the Company will enter into such
contracts.

Derivatives that have been designated as non-trading related positions are
accounted for on an accrual basis. Under the accrual basis, interest is accrued
into income or expense over the life of the contract, resulting in the net
interest impact of the derivative and the underlying hedged item being
recognized in income throughout the hedge period. Related unrealized receivables
or payables due from or to counterparties are included in receivables from or
payables to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations.

The Company also utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to manage the
currency exposure related to its net monetary investment in non-U.S. dollar
functional currency operations. The gain or loss from revaluing these contracts
is deferred and reported within Accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders' equity. The related unrealized receivables or payables due from or
to counterparties are included in receivables from or payables to brokers,
dealers and clearing organizations.

In the event that a hedge is no longer effective, the derivative transaction is
no longer accounted for as a hedge on an accrual basis. Instead, the Company
immediately recognizes the market or fair value of the derivative financial
instrument through earnings. Changes in the fair value of such derivative
contracts would then be accounted for as a derivative used for trading purposes
as discussed above. Realized gains or losses on early terminations of
derivatives that were classified as hedges are deferred and amortized to
interest income or interest expense over the remaining life of the instrument
being hedged.

REPURCHASE AND RESALE AGREEMENTS Securities purchased under agreements to resell
and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are treated as
financing transactions for financial reporting purposes, are collateralized
primarily by government and government agency securities and are carried net by
counterparty, when permitted, at the amounts at which the securities will be
subsequently resold or repurchased plus accrued interest. It is the policy of
the Company to take possession of securities purchased under agreements to
resell. The Company monitors the market value of the underlying positions on a
daily basis as compared to the related receivable or payable balances, including
accrued interest. The Company requires counterparties to deposit additional
collateral or return collateral pledged as necessary, to ensure that the market
value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient. Securities and other
financial instruments owned that are financed under repurchase agreements are
carried at market value with changes in market value reflected in the
Consolidated Statement of Income.

SECURITIES BORROWED AND LOANED Securities borrowed and securities loaned are
carried at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received plus accrued
interest. It is the Company's policy to value the securities borrowed and loaned
on a daily basis, and to obtain additional cash as necessary to ensure such
transactions are adequately collateralized.

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS The Company carries its private equity investments,
including its partnership interests, at fair value based upon the Company's
assessment of the underlying investments.

INVESTMENT BANKING Underwriting revenues and fees for merger and acquisition
advisory services are recognized when services for the transactions are
determined to be completed. Underwriting expenses are deferred and recognized at
the time the related revenues are recorded.

INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes." The Company recognizes the current and deferred tax consequences
of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using
the provisions of the enacted tax laws. In this regard, deferred tax assets are
recognized for temporary differences that will result in deductible amounts in
future years and for tax loss carry-forwards, if in the opinion of management,
it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. SFAS
109 requires companies to set up a valuation allowance for that component of net
deferred tax assets which



62
<PAGE>

does not meet the "more likely than not" criterion for realization. Deferred tax
liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will result in taxable
income in future years.

TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries
having non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at exchange rates at
the statement of financial condition date. Revenues and expenses are translated
at average exchange rates during the period. The gains or losses resulting from
translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars, net of
hedging gains or losses and taxes, are included in Accumulated other
comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders' equity. Gains or
losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the
Consolidated Statement of Income.

PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS Property, equipment and leasehold
improvements are recorded at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the lesser of their economic useful lives or the terms of the
underlying leases. Internal use software which qualifies for capitalization
under AICPA Statement of Position 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use," is capitalized and
subsequently amortized over the softwares' estimated useful life.

GOODWILL Excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired ("goodwill") is
amortized using the straight-line method over periods not exceeding 35 years.
Goodwill is evaluated periodically for impairment and also is reduced upon the
recognition of certain acquired net operating loss carryforward benefits.

STOCK-BASED AWARDS SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"
established financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based
employee compensation plans. SFAS No. 123 permits companies to either continue
accounting for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ("APB 25") or using the
fair value method prescribed by SFAS No. 123. The Company continues to follow
APB 25 and its related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based
compensation plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for
stock option awards because the exercise price was at or above the fair market
value of the Company's common stock on the grant date.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS For purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows, the Company defines cash equivalents as highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less, other than those held for sale in
the ordinary course of business.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE The Company computes earnings per common share in
accordance with SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share." Basic earnings per share is
computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS
reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities. All share and per
share amounts have been restated for the two-for-one common stock split,
effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend, which became effective October
20, 2000. See Notes 6 and 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
more information.

NOTE 2 / SHORT-TERM FINANCINGS

The Company obtains short-term financing on both a secured and unsecured basis.
The secured financing is obtained through the use of repurchase agreements and
securities loaned agreements, which are primarily collateralized by government,
agency and equity securities. The unsecured financing is generally obtained
through short-term debt and the issuance of commercial paper.

The Company's commercial paper and short-term debt financing is comprised of the
following:

BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITIES Holdings maintains a Revolving Credit Agreement (the
"Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of banks. Under the terms of the Credit
Agreement, the banks have committed to provide up to $2 billion for up to 364
days. Any loans outstanding on the commitment termination date may be extended
for up to an additional year at the option of Holdings. The Credit Agreement
contains covenants, which require, among other things that the Company maintain
specified levels of liquidity and tangible net worth.

In July 2000, the Company entered into a $1 billion Committed Securities
Repurchase Facility (the "Facility") for Lehman Brothers International (Europe)
("LBIE"), the Company's major operating entity in Europe. The Facility provides
secured multi-currency financing for a broad range of collateral types. Under
the terms of the Facility, the bank group will agree to provide funding for up
to one year on a secured basis. Any loans outstanding on the commitment
termination date may be extended for up to an additional year at the option of
LBIE. The Facility contains covenants that require, among other things that LBIE
maintain specified levels of tangible net worth.

There are no borrowings outstanding under either the Credit Agreement or the
Facility. The Company may use the Credit Agreement and the Facility for general
corporate purposes from time to time. The Company has maintained compliance with
the applicable covenants for both the Credit Agreement and the Facility at all
times.

</TABLE>

Of the Company's long-term debt outstanding as of November 30, 2000, $654
million is repayable prior to maturity at the option of the holder, at par
value. These obligations are reflected in the above table as maturing at their
put dates, which range from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2008, rather than at their
contractual maturities, which range from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2026. In
addition, $1,732 million of the Company's long-term debt is redeemable prior to
maturity at the option of the Company under various terms and conditions. These
obligations are reflected in the above table at their contractual maturity
dates.

The Company's interest in 3 World Financial Center was financed with U.S. dollar
fixed-rate senior notes totaling $224 million as of November 30, 2000. These
notes were unconditionally guaranteed by American Express and collateralized by
a first mortgage on the property. During the first quarter of 2001, these notes
were redeemed on their contractual maturity date.




                                                                              65

As of November 30, 2000, the Company had approximately $10.5 billion available
for the issuance of debt securities under various shelf registrations and debt
programs, which includes $4.9 billion of issuance availability under the
Company's Euro medium-term note program.

As of November 30, 2000, the Company's U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar debt
portfolios included approximately $849 million and $769 million, respectively,
of debt for which the interest rates and/or redemption values or maturity have
been linked to the performance of various indices including industry baskets of
stocks or commodities or events. Generally such notes are issued as floating
rate notes or the interest rates on such index notes are effectively converted
to floating rates based primarily on LIBOR through the use of interest rate,
currency and equity swaps.

END-USER DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES The Company utilizes a variety of derivative
products including interest rate, currency and equity swaps as an end user to
modify the interest rate characteristics of its long-term debt portfolio. The
Company actively manages the interest rate exposure on its long-term debt
portfolio through the use of interest rate and currency swaps to more closely
match the terms of the assets being funded and to minimize interest rate risk.
In addition, the Company utilizes cross-currency swaps to hedge its exposure to
foreign currency risk as a result of its non-U.S. dollar debt obligations, after
consideration of non-U.S. dollar assets which are funded with long-term debt
obligations in the same currency. In certain instances, two or more derivative
contracts may be utilized by the Company to manage the interest rate nature
and/or currency exposure of an individual long-term debt issuance. In these
cases, the notional amount of the derivative contracts may exceed the carrying
value of the related long-term debt issuance.

At November 30, 2000 and 1999, the notional amounts of the Company's interest
rate, currency and equity swaps related to its long-term debt obligations were
approximately $26.9 billion and $27.1 billion, respectively. In terms of
notional amounts outstanding, these derivative products mature as follows:

On an overall basis, the Company's long-term debt-related end-user derivative
activities resulted in an increase (decrease) in interest expense of
approximately $35 million, $(67) million and $(84) million in 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. In addition, the Company's end-user derivative activities
resulted in the following changes to the Company's mix of fixed and floating
rate debt and effective weighted-average rates of interest:

debentures of the Company; and (c) engaging in activities necessary or
incidental thereto. Two such trusts have issued securities to date, having an
aggregate liquidation value of $710 million. The following table summarizes the
financial structure of each such trust at November 30, 2000:

CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE VOTING, SERIES A AND SERIES B The Convertible Voting
Preferred Shares had a liquidation preference of $39.10 per share. The Series A
was issued in 1987. The Series B was issued in an exchange offer for the Series
A on July 11, 1997. During the first quarter of 2000, Holdings repurchased
2,258,311 of the Series B for an aggregate cost of $88 million. During the
fourth quarter, the Company exercised its option to redeem the shares of
Cumulative Convertible Voting Preferred Stock, Series A and Series B (together
the "Convertible Voting Preferred") effective December 15, 2000. As of that date
the Convertible Voting Preferred Shares were no longer outstanding. As of
November 30, 2000, 1,900 shares of the Series A and 3,834,058 shares of the
Series B were outstanding. Given the Company's intention to redeem the remaining
Convertible Voting Preferred, the $150 million aggregate redemption value was
transferred on the Company's Statement of Financial Condition from Preferred
stock to Preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption.


NOTE 5 / PREFERRED STOCK

Holdings is authorized to issue a total of 38,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
At November 30, 2000 and 1999, Holdings had 4,426,958 and 6,635,624,
respectively, of shares authorized, issued and outstanding under various series
as described below and under "Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares" in Note
4. All preferred stock has a dividend preference over Holdings' common stock in
the paying of dividends and a preference in the liquidation of assets.

SERIES C On May 11, 1998, Holdings issued 5,000,000 Depository Shares, each
representing 1/10th of a share of 5.94% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C
("Series C Preferred Stock"), $1.00 par value. These shares have a redemption
price of $500 per share, together with accrued and unpaid dividends. Holdings
may redeem any or all of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock
beginning on May 31, 2008. The $250 million redemption value of the shares
outstanding at November 30, 2000 is classified on the Company's Consolidated
Statement of Financial Condition as a component of Preferred stock.

<PAGE>

SERIES D On July 21, 1998, Holdings issued 4,000,000 Depository Shares, each
representing 1/100th of a share of 5.67% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D
("Series D Preferred Stock"), $1.00 par value. These shares have a redemption
price of $5,000 per share, together with accrued and unpaid dividends. Holdings
may redeem any or all of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock
beginning on August 31, 2008. The $200 million redemption value of the shares
outstanding at November 30, 2000 is classified on the Company's Consolidated
Statement of Financial Condition as a component of Preferred stock.

SERIES E On March 28, 2000, Holdings issued 5,000,000 Depository Shares, each
representing 1/100th of a share of Fixed/Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred
Stock, Series E ("Series E Preferred Stock"), $1.00 par value. The initial
cumulative dividend rate on the Series E Preferred Stock is 7.115% per annum
through May 31, 2005; thereafter the rate will be the higher of either the
three-month U.S. Treasury Bill rate, the 10-year Treasury constant maturity rate
or the 30-year U.S. Treasury constant maturity rate, in each case plus 1.15%,
but in any event not less than 7.615% nor greater than 13.615%. These shares
have a redemption price of $5,000 per share, together with accrued and unpaid
dividends. Holdings may redeem any or all of the outstanding shares of Series E
Preferred Stock beginning on May 31, 2005. The $250 million redemption value of
the shares outstanding at November 30, 2000 is classified on the Company's
Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as a component of Preferred stock.

REDEEMABLE VOTING In 1994, Holdings issued the Redeemable Voting Preferred Stock
to American Express and Nippon Life for $1,000. The holders of the Redeemable
Voting Preferred Stock are entitled to receive annual dividends through May 31,
2002 in an amount equal to 50% of the amount, if any, by which the Company's net
income for the preceding year exceeds $400 million, up to a maximum of $50
million, prorated in the case of the last dividend period, which runs from
December 1, 2001 to May 31, 2002. For the years ended November 30, 2000 and
1999, the Company's net income of $1,775 million and $1,132 million,
respectively, resulted in the recognition of dividends in each year in the
amount of $50 million on the Redeemable Voting Preferred Stock.

Holdings may not redeem shares of the Redeemable Preferred Stock prior to the
final dividend payment. However, in the event of a change of control of the
Company, holders of the Redeemable Preferred Stock will have the right to
require Holdings to redeem all of the stock for an aggregate redemption price
equal to $50 million if such change of control occurs prior to November 30,
2001. If a change of control is not approved by a majority of Holdings' Board of
Directors, the funds for redemption must be raised by an offering of Holdings'
equity securities which are not redeemable. The Redeemable Preferred Stock is
not convertible into common stock.


NOTE 6 / COMMON STOCK

On September 20, 2000, Lehman Brothers' Board of Directors declared a
two-for-one common stock split, to be effected in the form of a 100% stock
dividend, which became effective on October 20, 2000. The par value of the
common stock remained at $0.10 per share. Accordingly, a transfer from paid-in
capital to common stock of $12.5 million was made to preserve the par value of
the post-split shares. All share and per share amounts have been restated for
the effect of the split.

Changes in shares of Holdings' common stock (the "Common Stock") outstanding are
as follows:

The Company had reserved for issuance approximately 2.4 million shares of Common

<PAGE>

During the years ended November 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company repurchased
or acquired shares of its Common Stock at an aggregate cost of approximately
$1,203 million, $353 million and $469 million, respectively. These shares were
acquired in the open market and from employees who had tendered mature shares to
pay for the exercise cost of stock options and related tax withholding
obligations. These shares are being reserved for future issuances under employee
stock-based compensation plans.

In 1997, the Company established an irrevocable grantor trust (the "RSU Trust")
in order to provide common stock voting rights to employees who hold outstanding
restricted stock units and to encourage employees to think and act like owners.
The RSU Trust was initially funded in 1997 with a total of 32.0 million shares
consisting of 10.0 million treasury shares for restricted stock unit ("RSU")
awards under the Employee Incentive Plan and 22.0 million new issue shares of
Common Stock for RSU awards under the 1994 Management Ownership Plan. In 2000,
1999 and 1998, 11.8 million, 23.0 million and 5.0 million treasury shares,
respectively, were transferred into the RSU Trust. At November 30, 2000,
approximately 42.4 million shares were held in the RSU Trust with a total value
of approximately $647 million. For accounting purposes, these shares are valued
at weighted-average grant prices.

Shares transferred to the RSU Trust do not impact the total number of shares
used in the computation of earnings per common share because the Company
considers the RSUs as common stock equivalents for purposes of this computation.
Accordingly, the establishment of the RSU Trust has had no effect on the total
equity, net income or earnings per share of the Company.


NOTE 7 / INCENTIVE PLANS

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP")
allows employees to purchase Common Stock at a 15% discount from market value,
with a maximum of $25,000 in annual aggregate purchases by any one individual.
The number of shares of Common Stock authorized for purchase by eligible
employees is 12.0 million. As of November 30, 2000 and 1999, 5.2 million shares
and 4.8 million shares, respectively, of Common Stock had been purchased by
eligible employees through the ESPP.

1994 INCENTIVE PLANS The 1994 Management Replacement Plan (the "Replacement
Plan") provided awards similar to the American Express common shares granted to
Company employees which were canceled as of the date of the spin-off from
American Express. Through November 30, 2000, a total of 3.9 million awards had
been granted under the Replacement Plan, including both stock options and
restricted stock; 0.4 million were outstanding at November 30, 2000. No future
awards will be granted under this plan.

The Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 1994 Management Ownership Plan (the "1994
Plan") provides for the issuance of RSUs, performance stock units ("PSUs"),
stock options and other equity awards for a period of up to ten years to
eligible employees. A total of 33.3 million shares of Common Stock may be
granted under the 1994 Plan. At November 30, 2000, RSU and stock option awards
with respect to 31.3 million shares of Common Stock have been made under the
1994 Plan of which 2.9 million are outstanding and 28.4 million have been
converted to freely transferable Common Stock. The Company will utilize the
remaining authorization of 2.0 million shares to satisfy dividend reinvestment
requirements for outstanding awards and to fund the annual RSU awards for the
Company's non-employee directors.

1996 MANAGEMENT OWNERSHIP PLAN During 1996, the Company's stockholders approved
the 1996 Management Ownership Plan (the "1996 Plan") under which awards similar
to those of the 1994 Plan may be granted, and under which up to 42.0 million
shares of Common Stock may be subject to awards. At November 30, 2000, RSU, PSU
and stock option awards with respect to 29.7 million shares of Common Stock have
been made under the 1996 Plan of which 21.5 million are outstanding and 8.2
million have been converted to freely transferable Common Stock.

EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLAN The Employee Incentive Plan ("EIP") has provisions
similar to the 1994 Plan and the 1996 Plan, and authorization for up to 156.0
million shares of Common Stock which may be subject to awards. At November 30,
2000, awards with respect to 125.9 million shares of Common Stock have been made
under the EIP of which 112.5 million are outstanding and 13.4 million have been
converted to freely transferable Common Stock. Approximately 72.5 million of the
outstanding awards consist of RSUs and PSUs which have vesting and transfer
restrictions extending through the year 2006.

Eligible employees receive RSUs as a portion of their total compensation in lieu
of cash. There is no further cost to employees associated with the RSU awards.
The Company measures compensation cost for RSUs based on the market value of its
Common Stock at the grant date and amortizes this amount to expense over the
applicable vesting periods. RSU awards made to employees have various vesting
provisions and generally convert to unrestricted freely transferable Common
Stock five years from the grant date. Holdings accrues a dividend equivalent on
each RSU outstanding (in the form of additional RSUs), based on dividends
declared on its Common Stock.

In the third quarter of 2000, the Company delivered 11.5 million shares of its
Common Stock to current and former employees in satisfaction of RSUs awarded in
1995. Substantially all of the shares delivered were funded from the RSU Trust.
The Company also received 3.6 million shares from current and former employees
in satisfaction of applicable tax withholding requirements. Shares received were
recorded as treasury stock at an aggregate value of $168 million.

Of the RSUs outstanding at November 30, 2000, approximately 23.5 million RSUs
were vested, approximately 14.0 million RSUs will vest during fiscal 2001, and
the remaining RSUs will vest subsequent to November 30, 2001. At November 30,
2000, approximately 42.4 million shares of the Company's Common Stock were held
in the RSU Trust.

In addition to the RSUs included in the previous table, the Company has awarded
PSUs under the EIP to certain senior officers. The number of PSUs which may be
earned is dependent upon the achievement of certain performance levels within
predetermined performance periods. At the end of a performance period, any PSUs
earned will convert one-for-one to RSUs which then vest in three, four or five
years. As of December 31, 2000, approximately 6.9 million PSUs have been earned
to date, subject to vesting and transfer restrictions. The compensation cost for
the RSUs payable in satisfaction of PSUs is accrued over the combined
performance and vesting periods.

Total compensation cost recognized during 2000, 1999 and 1998 for the Company's
stock-based awards was approximately $520 million, $363 million and $221
million, respectively.

The disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 require companies which elect not to
record the fair value of stock-based compensation awards in the Consolidated
Statement of Income to provide pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings
per share in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as if the fair
value of stock-based compensation had been recorded. The Company utilized the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model to quantify the pro forma effects on net
income and earnings per common share of the fair value of the stock options
granted and outstanding during 2000, 1999 and 1998. Based on the results of the
model, the weighted-average fair value of the stock options granted was $9.91,
$6.99 and $6.18 for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The weighted-average
assumptions which were used for 2000, 1999 and 1998 included risk-free interest
rates of 6.27%, 5.25% and 5.01%, an expected life of 3.6 years, 3.5 years and
4.0 years, and expected volatility of 35%, 35% and 30%, respectively. In
addition, annual dividends of $0.22, $0.18 and $0.15 were assumed for the 2000,
1999 and 1998 options, respectively.

The Company's 2000, 1999 and 1998 pro forma net income would have been $1,725
million, $1,091 million and $723 million, respectively, compared to actual net
income of $1,775 million, $1,132 million and $736 million, respectively. Pro
forma earnings per common share for 2000, 1999 and 1998 would have been $6.32,
$3.99 and $2.55, respectively, compared to actual earnings per common share of
$6.38, $4.08 and $2.60, respectively. The pro forma amounts reflect the effects
of the Company's stock option grants and the 15% purchase discount from market
value offered to the Company's employees who participate in the ESPP.

addition, the Company's "AAA" rated derivatives subsidiaries, Lehman Brothers
Financial Products Inc. ("LBFP") and Lehman Brothers Derivative Products Inc.
("LBDP"), have established certain capital and operating restrictions which are
reviewed by various rating agencies. At November 30, 2000, LBFP and LBDP each
had capital which exceeded the requirement of the most stringent rating agency
by approximately $46 million and $26 million, respectively.

The regulatory rules referred to above, and certain covenants contained in
various debt agreements may restrict Holdings' ability to withdraw capital from
its regulated subsidiaries, which in turn could limit its ability to pay
dividends to shareholders. At November 30, 2000, approximately $5.7 billion of
net assets of subsidiaries were restricted as to the payment of dividends to
Holdings.

</TABLE>

The effective tax rate increased in 2000 due to an overall increase in the level
of pretax income, which lessened the relative impact of certain tax preference
items. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in the state and local
effective tax rate.

For the years ended November 30, 2000 and 1999, a net tax benefit of
approximately $373 million and $90 million, respectively, relating to
stock-based awards was credited to Additional paid-in capital. In addition, the
Company recorded $(8) million, $(11) million and $2 million of tax
(benefits)/provisions from the translation of foreign currencies, which was
recorded directly in Accumulated other comprehensive income, for the fiscal
years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Effective for 2000, the Company permanently reinvested its earnings in certain
foreign subsidiaries. As of November 30, 2000, $112 million of the Company's
accumulated earnings were permanently reinvested. At current tax rates,
additional federal income taxes (net of available tax credits) of $15 million
would become payable if such income were to be repatriated.

Deferred income taxes are provided for the differences between the tax basis of
assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. These temporary differences will result in future income or
deductions for income tax purposes and are measured using the enacted tax rates
that will be in effect when such items are expected to reverse. The Company
provides for deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries, which are not permanently reinvested.

                                                                              77

</TABLE>

The net deferred tax assets are included in Other assets in the accompanying
Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.

The valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets at November 30,
2000 and 1999 will reduce goodwill if future circumstances permit recognition.
The valuation allowance relates to temporary differences resulting from the 1988
acquisition of E.F. Hutton Group, Inc. (now known as LB I Group Inc.) which are
subject to separate company limitations. If future circumstances permit the
recognition of the acquired tax benefit, then goodwill will be reduced.

The Company has approximately $14 million of NOL carryforwards, substantially
all of which are attributable to the acquisition of LB I Group, Inc.


NOTE 12 / DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is based upon an underlying
asset (e.g., treasury bond), index (e.g., S&P 500) or reference rate (e.g.,
LIBOR). Over-the-counter ("OTC") derivative products are privately negotiated
contractual agreements that can be tailored to meet individual client needs and
include forwards, swaps and certain options including caps, collars and floors.
Exchange-traded derivative products are standardized contracts transacted
through regulated exchanges and include futures and certain option contracts
listed on an exchange.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into derivative
transactions both in a trading capacity and as an end user. Acting in a trading
capacity, the Company enters into derivative transactions to satisfy the needs
of its clients and to manage the Company's own exposure to market and credit
risks resulting from its trading activities (collectively, "Trading-Related
Derivative Activities"). As an end user, the Company primarily enters into
interest rate swap and option contracts to adjust the interest rate nature of
its funding sources from fixed to floating rates, and to change the index upon
which floating interest rates are based (e.g., Prime to LIBOR) (collectively,
"End User Derivative Activities").


78
<PAGE>

There is an extensive volume of derivative products available in the
marketplace, which can vary from a simple forward foreign exchange contract to a
complex derivative instrument with multiple risk characteristics involving the
aggregation of the risk characteristics of a number of derivative product types
including swap products, options and forwards. Listed below are examples of
various derivative product types along with a brief discussion of the
performance mechanics of certain specific derivative instruments.

SWAP PRODUCTS Interest rate swap products include interest rate and currency
swaps, leveraged swaps, swap options, and other interest rate option products
including caps, collars and floors. An interest rate swap is a negotiated OTC
contract in which two parties agree to exchange periodic interest payments
for a defined period, calculated based upon a predetermined notional amount.
Interest payments are usually exchanged on a net basis throughout the
duration of the swap contract. A currency swap is an OTC agreement to
exchange a fixed amount of one currency for a specified amount of a second
currency at the outset and completion of the swap term. Leveraged swaps
involve the multiplication of the interest rate factor upon which the
interest payment streams are based (e.g., Party A pays three times the
six-month LIBOR). Caps are contractual commitments that require the writer to
pay the purchaser the amount by which an interest reference rate exceeds a
defined contractual rate, if any, at specified times during the contract.
Conversely, a floor is a contractual commitment that requires the writer to
pay the amount by which a defined contractual rate exceeds an interest
reference rate at specified times over the life of the contract, if any.
Equity swaps are contractual agreements whereby one party agrees to receive
the appreciation (or depreciation) value over a strike price on an equity
investment in return for paying another rate, which is usually based upon
equity index movements or interest rates. Commodity swaps are contractual
commitments to exchange the fixed price of a commodity for a floating price
(which is usually the prevailing spot price) throughout the swap term.

OPTIONS Option contracts provide the option purchaser (holder) with the right
but not the obligation to buy or sell a financial instrument, commodity or
currency at a predetermined exercise price (strike price) during a defined
period (American Option) or at a specified date (European Option). The option
purchaser pays a premium to the option seller (writer) for the right to exercise
the option. The option seller is obligated to buy (put) or sell (call) the item
underlying the contract at a set price, if the option purchaser chooses to
exercise. Option contracts also exist for various indices and are similar to
options on a security or other instrument except that, rather than settling
physical with delivery of the underlying instrument, they are cash settled. As a
purchaser of an option contract, the Company is subject to credit risk, since
the counterparty is obligated to make payments under the terms of the option
contract, if the Company exercises the option. As the writer of an option
contract, the Company is not subject to credit risk but is subject to market
risk, since the Company is obligated to make payments under the terms of the
option contract if exercised.

Option contracts may be exchange-traded or OTC. Exchange-traded options are the
obligations of the exchange and generally have standardized terms and
performance mechanics. In contrast, all of the terms of an OTC option including
the method of settlement, term, strike price, premium and security are
determined by negotiation of the parties.

FUTURES AND FORWARDS Futures contracts are exchange-traded contractual
commitments to either receive (purchase) or deliver (sell) a standard amount or
value of a financial instrument or commodity at a specified future date and
price. Maintaining a futures contract requires the Company to deposit with the
exchange an amount of cash or other specified assets as security for its
obligation. Therefore, the potential for losses from exchange-traded products is
limited. As of November 30, 2000 the Company had approximately $1,505 million on
deposit with futures exchanges consisting of cash and securities (customer and
proprietary), and had posted approximately $302 million of letters of credit.
Additionally, futures exchanges generally require the daily cash settlement of
unrealized gains/losses on open contracts with the futures exchange. Therefore,
futures contracts provide a reduced funding alternative to purchasing the
underlying cash position in the marketplace. Futures contracts may be settled by
physical delivery of the underlying asset or cash settlement (for index futures)
on the settlement date or by entering into an offsetting futures contract with
the futures exchange prior to the settlement date.

Forwards are OTC contractual commitments to purchase or sell a specified
amount of a financial instrument, foreign currency or commodity at a future
date at a predetermined price. TBAs are forward contracts which give the
purchaser/seller an obligation to obtain/deliver mortgage securities in the
future. Therefore, TBAs subject the holder to both interest rate risk and
principal prepayment risk.

                                                                              79

TRADING-RELATED DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES Derivatives are subject to various risks
similar to other financial instruments including market, credit and operational
risk. In addition, the Company may also be exposed to legal risks related to its
derivative activities including the possibility that a transaction may be
unenforceable under applicable law. The risks of derivatives should not be
viewed in isolation, but rather should be considered on an aggregate basis along
with the Company's other trading-related activities. The Company manages the
risks associated with derivatives on an aggregate basis along with the risks
associated with its proprietary trading and market-making activities in cash
instruments as part of its firmwide risk management policies.

Derivatives are generally based upon notional amounts. Notional amounts are not
recorded on-balance sheet, but rather are utilized solely as a basis for
determining future cash flows to be exchanged. Therefore, notional amounts
provide a measure of the Company's involvement with such instruments, but are
not indicative of actual or potential risk.

The following table reflects the notional/contract amounts of the Company's
Trading-Related Derivative Activities:

Of the total notional amounts at November 30, 2000 and 1999, approximately
$3,171 billion and $2,706 billion are over-the-counter and $246 billion and $172
billion are exchange-traded, respectively. The total weighted-average maturity
at November 30, 2000, for over-the-counter and exchange-traded contracts was
3.88 years and 3.73 years, respectively. Approximately $1,213 billion of the
notional/contract amount of the Company's Trading-Related Derivative Activities
mature within the year ended November 30, 2001, of which approximately 36% have
maturities of less than one month.

The Company records its Trading-Related Derivative Activities on a
mark-to-market basis with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized
currently in Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
Unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts are recorded on a net basis
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition for those transactions with
counterparties executed under a legally enforceable master netting agreement and
are netted across products when such provisions are stated in the master netting
agreement. The Company offers equity, fixed income and foreign exchange products
to its customers. Because of the integrated nature of the market for such
products, each product area trades cash instruments as well as related
derivative products.

Listed in the following table is the fair value of the Company's Trading-Related
Derivative Activities as of November 30, 2000 and 1999 as well as the average
fair value of these instruments. Average fair values of these instruments were
calculated based upon month-end statement of financial condition values, which
the Company believes do not vary significantly from the average fair value
calculated on a more frequent basis. Variances between average fair values and
period-end values are due to changes in the volume of activities in these
instruments and changes in the valuation of these instruments due to variations
in market and credit conditions.

</TABLE>

* Amounts represent carrying value (exclusive of collateral) and do not include
  receivables or payables related to exchange-traded futures contracts.

Assets included in the table above represent the Company's unrealized gains, net
of unrealized losses for situations in which the Company has a master netting
agreement. Similarly, liabilities represent net amounts owed to counterparties.
Therefore, the fair value of assets/liabilities related to derivative contracts
at November 30, 2000 represents the Company's net receivable/payable for
derivative financial instruments before consideration of collateral. Included
within the $9,583 million fair value of assets at November 30, 2000 was $8,643
million related to swaps and other OTC contracts and $940 million related to
exchange-traded option and warrant contracts. Included within the $10,306
million fair value of assets at November 30, 1999 was $9,002 million related to
swaps and other OTC contracts and $1,304 million related to exchange-traded
option and warrant contracts.

The primary difference in risks related to OTC and exchange-traded contracts is
credit risk. OTC contracts contain credit risk for unrealized gains from various
counterparties for the duration of the contract, net of collateral. With respect
to OTC contracts, including swaps, the Company views its net credit exposure to
be $6,304 million at November 30, 2000, representing the fair value of the
Company's OTC contracts in an unrealized gain position, after consideration of
collateral.

                                                                              81
<PAGE>

Counterparties to the Company's OTC derivative products are primarily financial
intermediaries (U.S. and foreign banks), securities firms, corporations,
governments and their agencies, finance companies, insurance companies,
investment companies and pension funds. Collateral held related to OTC contracts
generally includes cash and U.S. government and federal agency securities.
Presented below is an analysis of the Company's net credit exposure at November
30, 2000 for OTC contracts based upon actual ratings made by external rating
agencies or by equivalent ratings established and utilized by the Company's
Credit Risk Management Department.

</TABLE>

The Company is also subject to credit risk related to its exchange-traded
derivative contracts. Exchange-traded contracts, including futures and certain
options, are transacted directly on the exchange. To protect against the
potential for a default, all exchange clearinghouses impose net capital
requirements for their membership. Additionally, the exchange clearinghouse
requires counterparties to futures contracts to post margin upon the origination
of the contract and for any changes in the market value of the contract on a
daily basis (certain foreign exchanges provide for settlement within three
days). Therefore, the potential for losses from exchange-traded products is
limited.

END-USER DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES The Company utilizes a variety of derivative
products as an end user to modify the interest rate characteristics of its
long-term debt portfolio. The Company actively manages the interest rate
exposure on its long-term debt portfolio through the use of interest rate and
currency swaps to more closely match the terms of its debt portfolio to the
assets being funded and to minimize interest rate risk. At November 30, 2000 and
1999, the notional amounts of the Company's end-user activities related to its
long-term debt obligations were approximately $26.9 billion and $27.1 billion,
respectively. (For a further discussion of the Company's long-term debt related
end-user derivative activities see Note 3.)

The Company also utilizes derivative products as an end user to modify its
interest rate exposure associated with its secured financing activities,
including securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities borrowed,
securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities loaned. At
November 30, 2000 and 1999, the Company had $216 billion and $167 billion,
respectively, of such secured financing activities. As with the Company's
long-term debt, its secured financing activities expose the Company to interest
rate risk. The Company, as an end user, manages the interest rate risk related
to these activities by utilizing derivative financial instruments, including
interest rate swaps and purchased options. The Company designates certain
specific derivative transactions against specific assets and liabilities with
matching maturities. In addition, the Company manages the interest rate risk of
anticipated secured financing transactions with derivative products. The Company
actively monitors the level of anticipated secured financing transactions to
ensure there is a high degree of certainty that such secured financing
transactions will be executed at levels at least equal to the designated
derivative product transactions. At November 30, 2000 and 1999, the Company, as
an end user, utilized derivative financial instruments with an aggregate
notional amount of $8.5 billion and $12.9 billion, respectively, to modify the
interest rate characteristics of its secured financing activities. The total
notional amount of these agreements had a weighted-average maturity of 3.5 years
and 2.3 years as of November 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. On an overall
basis, the Company's secured financing end-user derivative activities
(decreased) increased net revenues by approximately $(14) million, $(13) million
and $4 million for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

NOTE 13 / FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

SFAS No. 107 "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments" requires
the Company to report the fair value of financial instruments, as defined.
Assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value include all of the
Company's trading assets and liabilities including derivative financial
instruments used for trading purposes as described in Note 1, which are recorded
as securities and other financial instruments owned and securities and other
financial instruments sold but not yet purchased.

Assets and liabilities, which are recorded at contractual amounts that
approximate market or fair value include cash and cash equivalents, cash and
securities segregated and on deposit for regulatory and other purposes,
receivables, certain other assets, commercial paper and short-term debt, and
payables. The market value of such items are not materially sensitive to shifts
in market interest rates because of the limited term to maturity of these
instruments and their variable interest rates.

Financial instruments which are recorded at amounts that do not necessarily
approximate market or fair value include long-term debt, certain secured
financing activities and the related financial instruments utilized by the
Company as an end user to manage the interest rate risk of these exposures. The
Company's long-term debt is recorded at contractual or historical amounts. The
following table provides a summary of the fair value of the Company's long-term
debt and related end-user derivative activities. The fair value of the Company's
long-term debt was estimated using either quoted market prices or discounted
cash flow analyses based on the Company's current borrowing rates for similar
types of borrowing arrangements. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt
is subject to changes in its credit spreads, which fluctuated significantly in
2000 and 1999. The unrecognized net gain (loss) related to the Company's end-
user derivative activities reflects estimated fair values based on market rates
at November 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

</TABLE>

The Company carries its secured financing activities, including securities
purchased under agreements to resell, securities borrowed, securities sold under
agreements to repurchase, and securities loaned, at their original contract
amount plus accrued interest. As the majority of such financing activities are
short-term in nature, carrying value approximates fair value. At November 30,
2000 and 1999, the Company had $216 billion and $167 billion, respectively, of
such secured financing activities. As with the Company's long-term debt, its
secured financing activities expose the Company to interest rate risk.

At November 30, 2000 and 1999, the Company, as an end user, utilized derivative
financial instruments with an aggregate notional amount of $8.5 billion and
$12.9 billion, respectively, to modify the interest rate characteristics of its
secured financing activities. The unrecognized net losses related to these
derivative financial instruments were $22 million and $11 million at November
30, 2000 and 1999, respectively, which were substantially offset by unrecognized
net gains on the Company's secured financing activities, including anticipated
transactions during the hedge period. Additionally, at November 30, 2000 the
Company had approximately $8 million of unrecognized losses related to
approximately $1.4 billion of long-term fixed rate repurchase agreements as
compared to unrecognized net gains of approximately $23 million on approximately
$2.5 billion of such agreements at November 30, 1999.



                                                                              83

NOTE 14 / OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

As of November 30, 2000 and 1999, the Company was contingently liable for $2.1
billion of letters of credit, primarily used to provide collateral for
securities and commodities borrowed and to satisfy margin deposits at option and
commodity exchanges, and other guarantees.

In connection with its financing activities, the Company had outstanding
commitments under certain lending arrangements of approximately $3.2 billion and
$4.5 billion, at November 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. These commitments
require borrowers to provide acceptable collateral, as defined in the
agreements, when amounts are drawn under the lending facilities. Advances made
under the above lending arrangements are typically at variable interest rates
and generally provide for over-collateralization based upon the borrowers'
creditworthiness.

In addition, the Company, through its high grade and high yield sales, trading
and underwriting activities, makes commitments to extend credit in loan
syndication transactions and then participates out a significant portion of
these commitments. The Company had lending commitments to high grade borrowers
of $4.4 billion and $2.9 billion at November 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In
addition, lending commitments to high yield borrowers totaled $1.3 billion and
$1.4 billion at November 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. All of these
commitments and any related draw downs of these facilities are typically secured
against the borrower's assets, have fixed maturity dates, and are generally
contingent upon certain representations, warranties and contractual conditions
applicable to the borrower. Total commitments are not indicative of actual risk
or funding requirements, as the commitments may not be drawn or fully utilized,
and the Company will continue to syndicate and/or sell these commitments.

As of November 30, 2000, the Company had pledged securities, primarily fixed
income, having a market value of approximately $30.4 billion, as collateral for
securities borrowed having a market value of approximately $28.7 billion.

Securities and other financial instruments sold but not yet purchased represent
obligations of the Company to purchase the securities at prevailing market
prices. Therefore, the future satisfaction of such obligations may be for an
amount greater or less than the amount recorded. The ultimate gain or loss is
dependent upon the price at which the underlying financial instrument is
purchased to settle its obligation under the sale commitment.

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to off-balance sheet
credit and market risk as a result of executing, financing and settling various
customer security and commodity transactions. Off-balance sheet risk arises from
the potential that customers or counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations
and that the collateral obtained is insufficient. In such instances, the Company
may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at unfavorable market
prices. The Company seeks to control these risks by obtaining margin balances
and other collateral in accordance with regulatory and internal guidelines.

At November 30, 2000 and 1999, the Company had commitments to invest up to $357
million and $411 million, respectively, directly and through partnerships in
private equity related investments. These commitments will be funded as required
through the end of the respective investment periods, principally expiring in
2004.

Subsidiaries of the Company, as general partner, are contingently liable for the
obligations of certain public and private limited partnerships organized as
pooled investment funds or engaged primarily in real estate activities. In the
opinion of the Company, contingent liabilities, if any, for the obligations of
such partnerships will not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on
the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In the normal course of its business, the Company has been named a defendant in
a number of lawsuits and other legal proceedings. After considering all relevant
facts, available insurance coverage and the advice of outside counsel, in the
opinion of the Company such litigation will not, in the aggregate, have a
material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK As a leading global investment bank, the Company
is actively involved in securities underwriting, brokerage, distribution and
trading. These and other related services are provided on a worldwide basis to a
large and diversified group of clients and customers, including multinational
corporations, governments, emerging growth companies, financial institutions and
individual investors.

A substantial portion of the Company's securities and commodities transactions
is collateralized and is executed with, and on behalf of, commercial banks and
other institutional investors, including other brokers and dealers. The
Company's exposure to credit risk associated with the non-performance of these
customers and counterparties in fulfilling their contractual obligations
pursuant to securities transactions can be directly impacted by volatile or
illiquid trading markets, which may impair the ability of customers and
counterparties to satisfy their obligations to the Company.

Securities and other financial instruments owned by the Company include U.S.
government and agency securities, and securities issued by non-U.S. governments,
which in the aggregate, represented 12% of the Company's total assets at
November 30, 2000. In addition, primarily all of the collateral held by the
Company for resale agreements represented 36% of total assets at November 30,
2000, and consisted of securities issued by the U.S. government, federal
agencies or non-U.S. governments. The Company's most significant industry
concentration is financial institutions, which include other brokers and
dealers, commercial banks and institutional clients. This concentration arises
in the normal course of the Company's business.

LEASE COMMITMENTS The Company leases office space and equipment throughout the
world and is a party to a ground lease with the Battery Park City Authority
covering its headquarters at 3 World Financial Center which extends through
2069. Total rent expense for 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $47 million, $37 million
and $39 million, respectively. Certain leases on office space contain escalation
clauses providing for additional rentals based upon maintenance, utility and tax
increases.

Minimum future rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases (net of
subleases of $57 million) are as follows:

The following information describes the Company's methods of allocating
consolidated net revenues to geographic regions. Net revenues, if syndicated or
trading-related, have been distributed based upon the location where the primary
or secondary position was fundamentally risk managed: if fee-related, by the
location of the senior coverage banker; if commission-related, by the location
of the salespeople. In addition, certain revenues associated with domestic
products and services which resulted from relationships with international
clients and customers have been reclassified as international revenues using an
allocation consistent with the Company's internal reporting.

</TABLE>

(a)  Matched book represents "securities purchased under agreements to resell"
     ("reverse repos") to the extent that such balance is less than "securities
     sold under agreements to repurchase" ("repos") as of the statement of
     financial condition date. Several nationally recognized rating agencies
     consider such reverse repos to be a proxy for matched book assets when
     evaluating the Company's capital strength and financial ratios. Such
     agencies consider matched book assets to have a low risk profile and
     exclude such amounts in the calculation of leverage (total assets divided
     by total stockholders' equity and trust preferred securities). Although
     there are other assets with similar risk characteristics on the Company's
     Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition, the exclusion of reverse
     repos from total assets in this calculation reflects the fact that these
     assets are matched against liabilities of a similar nature, and therefore
     require minimal amounts of capital support. Accordingly, the Company
     believes the ratio of total assets excluding matched book to total
     stockholders' equity and trust preferred securities to be a more meaningful
     measure of the Company's leverage.
(b)  Long-term debt includes senior notes and subordinated indebtedness.
(c)  Total capital includes long-term debt, stockholders' equity and preferred
     securities subject to mandatory redemption.
(d)  All share and per share data have been restated for the two-for-one common
     stock split effective October 20, 2000.
(e)  After redeemable preferred dividend.
